            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is neither ambition nor coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes (Right Honourable) that moueth me to publiſh this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to the view of all, which not long ſince I deliuered to the eares of a few, being then Lecturer in the Citie of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> but partly the motion of ſome friends, partly and chiefly the ſatisfying of ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſpirits haue in a manner wreſted from me that, whereto otherwiſe I had little affection. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit through writing bookes, is a thing of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hazard, by reaſon of the varietie of cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that it is doubtfull whether a man ſhall winne or loſe thereby: Gaine alſo is ſo ſlender, as that, for a booke of a yeeres paines and ſtudie, it will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard matter to attaine, if it were ſet to ſale in
<pb facs="tcp:18172:3"/> Pauls Church-yard, ſo much money as inck, paper, and light coſt him that penned it: ſo as except a man ſhould doate, hee muſt haue better grounds of publiſhing his writings, than either <hi>credit</hi> or <hi>gaine:</hi> eſpeciallie conſidering the plentifull harueſt of bookes of all ſorts, amongſt which there appeareth variable contention. In ſome it is queſtionable, whether wit or learning getteth the victorie: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the ſtrife is betwixt wit and the truth: ſome bewray diſſentions betwixt conſcience and policie: others contend after other faſhions: All declare thus much, that except a man can adde ſomething new of his owne, it is vanitie to write bookes: for otherwiſe a man ſhal ſooner get mocks than thanks for his paines. Wherefore I doe profeſſedlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ambitious affection of credit, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſire of gaine: and betake my ſelf to a better refuge, which is the cleering of my ſelfe from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt imputations and accuſations. I haue beene ſtrangely traduced for the doctrine I taught out of the Lords Prayer: I haue been vrged to anſwere in defence of the doctrine I deliuered touching that ſubiect, before the Magiſtrate eccleſiaſtical: as if ſo be I called in queſtion the truth thereof. For the cleering of the truth I am bold to publiſh this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe: wherein (I proteſt before the God of heauen, and before your Lordſhip) I haue truly ſet downe the ſubſtance of all that which I deliuered in handling the Lords Prayer. I muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is not word for word the ſame (for that were impoſſible to me) yet to my knowledge it differeth not in any materiall circumſtance: nay I
<pb facs="tcp:18172:3"/> doe verily thinke that if I miſſe the truth, it is rather in the writing than in the preaching. Howſoeuer it be, I moſt humbly beſeech your Honour to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the patronage of this traduced Pamphlet: I muſt acknowledge it is preſumption in me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vpon your Honour the ſcandall of countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſo ſuſpitious a writing (for who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhal gaine the approbation of the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when it commeth to their cenſure?) but for that your Lordſhip had the managing of the cauſe of difference betwixt my accuſers and me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this occaſion, and for that your Honour ſo wiſely and charitably compounded the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie on both parts to the contentment of either of vs; your Lordſhip might iuſtly challenge a greater title herein, than any other whatſoeuer: wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it proue a troubleſome burthen, I beſeech your Honour not to refuſe it: the rather for that the honourable intereſt which your Lordſhip hath in the affections and iudgements of men honeſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, will ſo farre preuaile, as to cleere your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the leaſt ſpot of diſhonour, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might accrew through the patronage of ſo dangerous a tractate: yet thus much I may be bold to aſſure your Lordſhip, that this Treatiſe paſſeth with approbation to the preſſe; and doth not ſhroud it ſelfe in <hi>tenebris,</hi> as if it either ſhamed or feared the light: which may be ſome reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Honour the rather to receiue it into your Honourable protection: for my ſelfe I freelie confeſſe, there is in me no abilitie to declare my thankfulnes to your Lordſhip, otherwiſe than by

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued, marueile not that after ſo many expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the Lords Prayer, this Pamphlet ſteppeth vp, as if ſo be it had ſome thing to ſay beſides that which hath been alreadie ſpoken: to confeſſe the truth, I geſſe it may occaſion the iudicious reader to enter into a more inward view of Chriſts purpoſe in propounding that prayer: perhaps alſo the manner of handling the ſeuerall petitions may giue ſome light: but my intent was none of theſe, when I intended to publiſh the treatiſe: onely the cleering of my ſelfe from vniuſt accuſations, and the ſatisfying of a few friends moued me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but whatſoeuer it be, and howſoeuer vttered, I pray thee of charitie to conſtrue (a thing indifferently done) to the better part: eſpecially thoſe few questions reſolued in the latter end of the treatiſe. I doe here ingenuouſly confeſſe that I am far from the opinion of them which ſeparate from our Church, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſet forme of prayer (although from ſome of them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued part of my education in Cambridge) for I doe verily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe vpon ſuch grounds as I haue deliuered in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that a ſet forme of prayer is not vnlawfull: yet as Moſes wiſhed that all the people of God could prophecie, ſo doe I wiſh that all the people of God could conceiue prayer: the rather for that perſonall wants, bleſſings, and iudgements are not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed particularly according to their ſeuerall circumſtances in any forme of prayer poſſibly to be deuiſed: wherefore I deſire that no man mistake me in this treatiſe: I doe iudge that there is no one doctrine or opinion contrarie to the doctrine of this Church in all this tractate: in reſpect whereof I hope it ſhall finde more indifferent cenſure at thy hands. And for that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit which ſome perhaps haue intertained at the hearing of the doctrine when I taught in Lincolne, I doe alſo as freely and
<pb facs="tcp:18172:5"/> truly proteſt, that I neuer durſt admit (I bleſſe God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) ſo blaſphemous a thought into my minde, as to ſurmiſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayer, commonly called the Lords prayer, be the prayer which Chriſt taught his Diſciples, or no: for I doe with my ſoule confeſſe it to be the ſame prayer in ſubſtance which Christ deliuered to his Diſciples: therefore I pray thee gentle reader, whoſoeuer thou art, to accept this treatiſe, and to blame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie rather than me for publiſhing it: for the phraſe and ſtyle it is homely, I confeſſe, and plaine; for I doe not intend the benefit of the ſtyle to the learned, but to the vnlearned for the better vnderstanding of the matter: the truth and homelines may well ſort together, and the truth is not to be reiected for her plainnes, rather I wiſh that men in heauenly matters could frame themſelues to the capacitie of the meaneſt, which is the ſureſt way: ſeeing that learned men can vnderstand things plainly deliuered, but the vnlearned cannot conceiue the eaſieſt doctrines, except they be deliuered alſo after an eaſie manner, with homely, familiar and eaſie ſpeeches. Now if any man attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this plainnes of mine vſed in this treatiſe to ignorance and want of skill, I will not endeuour to weede that preiudice out of his minde, ſeeing that I profeſſe it to be a part of my ſtudie to ſpeake plainly: and I ſee no reaſon that ſeeing ſpeech is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the minde, the interpreter ſhould need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreter or commentary. So crauing againe thy charitable cenſure, I bid thee hartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the Lord. <hi>Pray for vs brethren.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, the neceſſitie of prayer may alſo appeare vnto vs by other conſiderations, as namely of the vſe of prayer: for prayer is that onely meanes in thee whereby thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt or obtaineſt from God ſauing bleſſings: for Gods promiſes are conditionall: <hi>Aske and it ſhall be giuen you: ſeeke and ye ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you:</hi> If you aske not,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> you ſhall not receiue: you ſhall receiue, but you muſt firſt aske, ſeeke, knocke, pray. Now if it be alledged that many men haue abundance of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which neuer aske them of God, ſeeing that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray being wicked: it may be anſwered, that they be not ſauing bleſſings, and ſo indeede they are not true bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18172:6"/> if we will ſpeake properly: for there is a ſecret poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inſenſibly in heart in all the bleſſings of God, and in all the creatures, which we vſe in the world, by reaſon of the curſe wherewith God curſed the earth for mans ſake:<note place="margin">Gen 3.</note> which poyſon God neuer remoueth away till we beg it by prayer of him. Hence it commeth, that ſeeing wicked men doe not, nor cannot pray, therefore though they haue many bleſſings in ſhew, yet in truth they are not ſo, but rather curſes, euen the verie poyſon and bane of their ſoules, meanes to haſten their damnation, and to drench the deeper in the pit of hell another day: whereas contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe the godly asking bleſſings of God, he in mercie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth this curſe from the righteous mans goods, and maketh his bleſſings ſauing bleſſings vnto him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt be bleſſed of God, thou muſt of neceſſitie pray: otherwiſe thy bleſſings ſhall be accurſed of God.</p>
            <p>The third conſideration of the neceſſitie of prayer,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.22. Ioh. 17.</note> is the example of <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt and all the Saints of God that euer haue liued; whoſe example implieth a neceſſitie of imitation.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocencie being free from ſinne, notwithſtanding had neede to pray, and no doubt did pray, for perſeuerance, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in grace: for it muſt needes be graunted that during his innocencie he kept the law; and one part of the law is prayer, as was ſaid before: wherefore if <hi>Adam,</hi> as yet free from ſinne, and all the puniſhments of ſinne, did pray, much more we haue neede to pray, vpon whom both ſinne and Gods curſe haue taken ſuch faſt hold.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, who knew no ſinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there guile found in his mouth, did pray and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pray, being made vnder the law for vs: and therefore he ſometime continued a whole night in prayer, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often a little before his apprehenſion. If Chriſt did pray, and had neede ſo to doe, lyeth there not a great and ineuitable neceſſitie vpon vs to pray? Finally all the Saints of God that euer liued did pray and needed to pray, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18172:7"/> 
               <hi>Dauid, Daniel, Paul</hi> and the reſt, and yet the beſt of vs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compare with any of theſe: wherefore there is a great neceſſitie lying vpon vs, whereby we muſt be ſtirred vp to performe this dutie of prayer vnto God, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is a principall part of Gods worſhip, and the propertie of a true child of God: wheras it is the propertie of a wicked man not to pray. Therefore it is not a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different or arbitrarie, left in our choyſe to pray or not to pray, but it is a matter of meere neceſſitie, abſolutely enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery Chriſtian vpon paine of damnation: and yet it is a wonder to ſee how this dutie is neglected by many, who paſſe ouer daies and yeres prophanely and Atheiſtlike, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer calling vpon God in prayer, as if either there were no God, or no neceſſitie of worſhipping this God by prayer.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the neceſſitie of prayer, or that we muſt pray. Seeing then this dutie of prayer muſt bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for the practiſing thereof theſe two circumſtances muſt be conſidered; The time, and the place of prayer: for euery action muſt be done in time and place.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the time.</p>
            <p>The time is threefold.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt circumſtance of the time is: When.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVhen we muſt pray.</note>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.17. Which muſt not be vnderſtoode as ſome heretikes haue deemed called <hi>Euchitae,</hi> that a man muſt doe nothing but pray; but the meaning of it is, that there muſt neuer a day ouerpaſſe vs, but therein certaine times we muſt pray: more plainely and diſtinctly thus: 1. Pray at the enterpriſing and ending of all thy affaires, pray vpon all occaſions. 2. Pray vnto thy liues end, neuer ceaſe praying till thy ſoule part from thy body. Now although this bee generally true, that a man muſt pray vpon all occaſions, yet it is not needefull that a man ſhould vpon euery ſeuerall occaſion fall downe vpon his knees and vtter a long prayer to the ſpending of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18172:7"/> time and hindering his affaires; but a man muſt from his heart ſend vp prayers to heauen, if it be but a wiſh or ſigh or groane of the ſpirit, or ſuch a ſhort prayer as the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane vſed, or the theefe vpon the croſſe, vpon all our occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This we ſee warranted by the practiſe of <hi>Nehemia:</hi> who before he made his petition to the King for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring of Ieruſalem, prayed vnto the God of heauen:<note place="margin">Nehem. 2.4.</note> no doubt this was inwardly with a ſigh of the ſpirit vnto the Lord who knoweth the heart, as may be ſeene in the text. Furthermore, and ſpecially we are to vnderſtand that the principall occaſions and times of prayer are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The time of religious exerciſes.</item>
               <item>2. The time of affliction.</item>
               <item>3. The time of eating and drinking and vſing phyſicke.</item>

               <item>6. The time of recreation and ſporting.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The truth of all theſe appeareth by that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writeth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.4, 5.</note> that <hi>euery creature</hi> or appointment <hi>of God is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer, and thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</hi> Gods word warranteth vs the lawfull vſe thereof: prayer obtaineth the bleſſing from God, in the vſe of it: thankſgiuing returneth the praiſe to God, who gaue the bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance of time is,<note place="margin">How oft we muſt pray.</note> how oft we muſt pray. <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed three times a day, Dan. 6.10. <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed ſeauen times a day. Pſal. 119.164. euen ſo oft as we alter our affaires and enterpriſe new buſines: as hearing or reading the word: working and laboring in thy ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, eating and drinking, ſleeping, &amp;c. alſo vpon all extraordinarie occaſions: as iudgements, and bleſſings: all which are things of ſeuerall condition, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our affaires being changed, our prayers are to be repeated and renewed.</p>
            <p>The falſe Church of Antichriſt hath deuiſed certaine houres which they call Canonicall; which are in number
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18172:8"/> eight, as Father <hi>Robert</hi> rehearſeth them: which muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued euery day, and cannot be omitted without deadly ſinne, as he teacheth: but we are to know that Chriſtians muſt ſtand faſt in that libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free:<note place="margin">Galath 5.</note> and ſeeing that we are redeemed with a price, we muſt not be the ſeruants of men,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> much leſſe of times: only thus much; the Lords day of conſcience, being Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, muſt be kept as oft as it commeth: and ſeeing the Church for order and conueniencie hath appointed certaine houres, when all the Church publikely may come together to worſhip God; therefore we cannot breake that holy cuſtome and conſtitution without confuſion, and ſcandall, and breach of charitie: for priuate prayer, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate neceſſities, occaſions, and opportunities may afford a godly heart ſufficient inſtruction, alwayes remembring that there is no time vnfit to worſhip God in.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How long we muſt pray.</note>The third circumſtance of time to be conſidered, is, how long we muſt pray. Our Sauiour Chriſt giueth vs this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction generally by way of parable, that we ought not to waxe faint in prayer: the Apoſtle willeth vs to pray with all perſeuerance and to watch thereunto:<note place="margin">Luk. 18.1. Epheſ. 6.18.</note> as Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, <hi>Watch and pray.</hi> This then is the ftrſt rule for the length of our prayers: that we be not wearie. The ſecond rule is, that we are to pray ſo long as the ſpirit of God feedeth vs with matter of prayer: for otherwiſe we ſhould ſtint the ſpirit of prayer. Chriſt prayed till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; our infirmitie will not beare that: wherefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ceaſe praying when the ſpirit ceaſeth to miniſter matter, than to continue ſtill and babble: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here we muſt know; Firſt, it is our dutie to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our corruption: Secondly, it is our dutie to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our ſoule before prayer with premeditate matter; that ſo comming to pray, and hauing our hearts filled with matter, we may better continue in prayer: for as a man that hath filled his belly with meate, is better able to holde out at his labour than being faſting; euen ſo he that firſt repleniſheth his ſoule with meditations of his owne ſinnes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18172:8"/> and wants, of Gods iudgements and bleſſings vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and others, ſhall be better furniſhed to continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in hartie and feruent prayer, than comming ſodainly to pray without ſtrengthening himſelfe aforehand thereunto. To conclude this point, all prayers are either long or ſhort: a long feruent prayer is beſt; a ſhort feruent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is better than long babling; a ſhort prayer, containing all thy grace and matter in thy ſoule, is acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance to be conſidered, needefull for practiſe of prayer, is the place where we muſt pray.<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re we muſt pray.</note> As was ſaid before, there is no time vnfit to pray: ſo there is no place vnfit for prayer. The world, and euery place in the world is fit for a Chriſtian to call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of the Lord.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.20.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth men in all places to lift vp pure hands,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.8.</note> that is, to pray: Chriſt prayed vpon the mountaine, in the garden, in the wildernes; <hi>Peter</hi> vpon the houſe top; <hi>Paul</hi> on the ſea ſhore; <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly in the bottom of the ſea: but the ſuperſtitious papiſts will haue ſome place more holy than others: hence come there pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to ſuch a holy place, hoping thereby ſooner to obtaine their petitions: therefore alſo they thinke the church-yard holy ground, the Church holyer than the Church-yard, the Chancell then the Church, and the high altar more holy than the reſt of the chancell. True it is indeed, that when the Church of God is aſſembled in the Church, the place is: more holy but not for any inherent holines in the ground, but becauſe of Gods preſence among his people, and becauſe of holy actions there performed: in regard whereof it is ſacriledge to offer violence to ſuch places, or any way to prophane them; yet God will aſſoone heare thy prayer at home in thy cloſet, as in the Church; though the publike prayers are more effectuall than pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate. Finally, to ſhut vp this point: in regard of place, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are publike or priuate.</p>
            <p>The place of publike prayer is the aſſembly of the Saints whereſoeuer it be, which ſometime in perſecution was in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18172:9"/> priuate houſes, or in caues of the earth, or the wildernes, or mountaines.<note place="margin">Act 1.13. Heb. 11 38.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The place of priuate prayer is the houſe, or the cloſet, or ſome ſuch fit place in ſecret: not the market place, nor the corners of the ſtreete: though I doubt not but a man may ſigh and groane to the Lord walking in the ſtreete and making his markets;<note place="margin">Mat. 6.5.6.</note> but the outward ſignes of prayer priuate muſt then be concealed from the ſight of men, leaſt wee appeare to men as hypocrits. Hitherto of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of prayer, with the time and place of performing that dutie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond generall thing to be conſidered in the dutie which Chriſt enioyneth his diſciples, is, the manner how we muſt pray,<note place="margin">How we muſt pray.</note> which is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>After this manner pray ye.</hi> The meaning of which words muſt needes be one of theſe things following, that is to ſay; Pray either

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now which of theſe things our Sauiour Chriſt doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne, ſhall appeare by the ſeuerall conſideration of euery one of theſe ſeauen things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt doth not commaund vs to pray theſe words onely: for then we ſhould offend if we vſed any other words; and words without matter is babling: and Chriſt ſpake in the Hebrew tongue, the Euangeliſts wrote in the Greeke tongue: but Chriſt will not haue vs ſpeake Greeke and Hebrew only when we pray: therfore it is euident, that Chriſt commaundeth not to ſay, and ſo tyeth vs not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to theſe words onely.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he doth not enioyne vs to pray onely in this order or method: for then whoſoeuer vſeth any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſt commaundeth vs Matth. 6.

            <p>Fourthly, he doth not commaund theſe words and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as hath been prooued in the ſecond and third parts.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, he commaundeth not this matter in this method, as is proued in the ſecond and third parts.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, he commandeth not theſe words matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as may appeare by all the former parts: wherefore in the laſt place it followeth neceſſarily, this being a ſufficient enumeration of parts, that he commandeth vs to pray on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this matter: as if when Chriſt ſaid thus: <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray:</hi> hee ſhould haue ſaid, pray: 1. the matter herein contained, and 2. with the affections here expreſſed. This then is the meaning of theſe words, and here Chriſt tieth vs to the matter and affections of this prayer. To proceed: Although Chriſt commandeth not theſe words and matter and method, yet he doth not forbid them; for in the whole Scripture there is no ſuch prohibition: wherefore Chriſt leaueth it arbitrarie vnto vs, as a thing indifferent when we pray to ſay this prayer, or not to ſay it, ſo be that we ſay it in faith and feeling; or if wee ſay it not,<note place="margin">VVhether a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18172:10"/> Prayer as a ſet prayer, or any other preſcribed forme of prayer: but that they are in a manifeſt error it may appeare by theſe conſiderations enſuing.</p>
            <p>For if it bee lawfull to vſe the ſalutation of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the bleſſing of <hi>Moſes:</hi> then wee may lawfully vſe the Lords Prayer, or any other prayer in holie Scripture agreeable thereto for a prayer. For <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe vſed alwaies one manner of ſalutation; our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, as is very probable, vſed one of <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes with his Diſciples, after the firſt inſtitution and celebration of his Supper;<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.</note> and the 92 Pſalme was vſually in the church of the Iewes ſung vpon the Sabbath day: and <hi>Moſes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vſed one manner of prayer at the remouing of the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Numb. 6.24.25.26. and 10.35.36.</note> and another at the pitching thereof: which euidently ſerueth for the ouerthrow of that opinion which they of late haue deuiſed, contrarie to the practiſe of the ancient Church, and all the reformed Churches in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, who haue an vniforme order of publike prayer, one and the ſame almoſt in the very forme of words: and plainly confirmeth vs in the preſent truth wee hold, that it is lawfull to vſe the prayers in Scriptures, or any other prayers made by the Saints of God to our hands conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scriptures: and yet notwithſtanding, here are ſome cautions to be remembred.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That wee labour to inſinuate our ſelues as much as may be into the grace and affections expreſſed in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the makers thereof: that ſo wee may pray with the ſame ſpirit they did indite and vſe them, hauing by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conſideration and vnderſtanding of them as it were made them our owne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This vſing of other mens prayers is rather allowed to young Chriſtians that want the gift of conceiuing and vttering an orderly prayer: or to thoſe that want audacitie and boldnes to ſpeake before others, than to ſtrong and exerciſed Chriſtians, vnto whom God hath vouchſafed the gift of knowledge and vtterance and boldnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſafer to conceiue a prayer, than to reade a prayer:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18172:10"/> for a man may reade a prayer, and neither vnderſtand it, nor conſider the matter thereof, nor affect or deſire the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions therein contained, hauing his minde peſtred with wandring thoughts: but hee that conceiueth a prayer, though perhaps hee doe not deſire the things he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, yet at the leaſt he muſt haue attention, and ſo be free from many wandring thoughts, he muſt haue alſo memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and knowledge and conſideration, needfull all for the inuenting of matter; and ſo there is leſſe feare of babling in conceiuing a prayer, than reading one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An vniforme order of publike prayer in the ſeruice of God is neceſſarie.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 29.30</note> Thus the Prieſts and Leuites in the old Teſtament praiſed God with the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Aſaph:</hi> which Pſalmes were framed of thoſe holie men and ſent to the Muſitions to bee ſung vpon Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus all the reformed Churches vſe: thus the Church immediatly after the Apoſtles time vſed: yea thus in the time of the Apoſtles vſed the Church of Corinth:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.26.</note> as may probably bee gathered by that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh concerning the bringing of a Pſalme into the publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, notwithſtanding in priuate prayer when a Chriſtian being alone calleth vpon the name of God, it ſeemeth moſt expedient and profitable that he powre out his ſoule vnto God with ſuch a forme of words as hee can, for there and then the edification of other is no end of his prayer, as it is of publike prayer:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.26.</note> and the Lord hee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the heart, and hee knoweth the meaning of the ſpirit, though thy ſpeeches bee neuer ſo ragged and broken, though thy ſentences bee neuer ſo ſhort and imperfect, though thy words be rude and barbarous: and yet a man ought to labour to glorifie God with the beſt of his lippes alſo.

               </label> For they ſay it is to quench the ſpirit, &amp; to limit the ſpirit of God that teacheth vs to pray. For anſwere whereof we are to know, that as he cannot be ſaid to quench the ſpirit that readeth a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18172:11"/> chapter of holy Scripture and no more, or that preacheth a ſermon which he hath premeditate; ſo alſo he cannot bee ſaid to quench the ſpirit that pray th a portion of holie Scripture, as the Lords Prayer, or the ſalutation of <hi>Paul,</hi> or a Pſalme of <hi>Dauid,</hi> or any other prayer agreeable to the word which hee hath premeditate before and committed to memorie: for the ſpirit is not limited, though kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of holy Scripture, as it ought to be. Againe, in a prayer which a man readeth, though a man doe not ſpeake euerie thing that the ſpirit of God putteth into his heart, yet hee quencheth not the ſpirit: for to quench the ſpirit is to oppoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gainſt the voyce of the ſpirit. Neither is it to limit or ſtint the ſpirit, if a man pray it with his ſoule, though hee ſpeake not the words. For example ſake: I ſay the Lords Prayer: yea when I ſpeake theſe words; <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread,</hi> there commeth into my ſoule by the motion of Gods ſpirit this petition: Grant me grace to be content with the mediocritie thou haſt giuen me. If I pray this in my heart, though I doe not vtter theſe very words, yet I cannot bee ſaid to ſtint the ſpirit: for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that petition is comprehended in that fourth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Lords Prayer. So likewiſe reading any prayer agreeable to holy ſcripture, and hauing attention to the matter read, though many motions come into my minde vpon conſideration of the words of that prayer which I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not in particular ſpeeches, yet I vtter them in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">How ignorant perſons abuſe prayer.</note>The ignorant perſon abuſeth it, for that he thinketh the very ſaying of the words, though hee vnderſtand not the matter ſignified in the words, to be a good and acceptable ſeruice of God: which is very abſurd.</p>
            <p>For firſt, hee that prayeth muſt pray in faith, if hee will haue his prayer granted:<note place="margin">Iam. 1.6.7.</note> Iam. 1. for that man that wanteth faith ſhall not receiue any thing of the Lord: but where there is no knowledge of the maine articles of faith, there can be no faith:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.15.</note> for faith commeth by hearing, learning, and knowing of the word of God expounded in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie thereof.

            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.26.</note>2. It is expreſſely ſet downe by the Apoſtle, that a man muſt pray with the ſpirit and with the vnderſtanding, that is, ſo that another may vnderſtand him when he prayeth: if ſo as other may vnderſtand, then much more muſt he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand himſelfe: if a man therefore pray, not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the prayer hee ſaith, hee abuſeth it; but ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pray without vnderſtanding: wherefore they abuſe both this and all the reſt of their prayers. Therefore it were better for them to ſay fiue words with knowledge, than to ſay their <hi>Pater noster,</hi> or any other prayer tenne times as long, without vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15.8. Eſay. 29.</note>3. Finally, our Sauiour Chriſt out of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> reprooueth the hypocriticall Iewes, for that they did draw neere with their lips, but their hearts were a farre off, and requireth that they draw neere both with heart and lippes, when they come to worſhip God: but a man cannot draw
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18172:12"/> neere with his hart, except the vnderſtanding and the mind goe before as the leader of the heart (wherefore the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is compared to the wagoner or coachman that directeth and guideth the horſe with whip and bridle, that is, reſtraineth the headſtrong and vntamed affections, and ordreth then aright by reaſon rightly ruled: they therfore that want vnderſtanding of their prayers, although they may ſay they haue a good heart and affections, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that the hart ſhould be right, except the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bee right, which is by knowledge: wherefore all is wrong and amiſſe, and therefore thou abuſeſt thy prayer, except thou vnderſtand what thou prayeſt. To end this firſt point, prayer is the labour of the minde and heart, not of the lips: and all they that make it a lip-labour onely, as all ignorant perſons doe, abuſe this and all other prayers. For foure things are neceſſarie to pray this prayer, or any other prayer in ſpeech.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou muſt vnderſtand it, as alreadie hath bin ſaid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou muſt affect and deſire the prayers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou muſt vtter the words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Heart, tongue and minde muſt accord in euery pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and euery ſeuerall matter: wherefore the tongue muſt not runne before our wits, as wee ſay in our common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe: but firſt our hearts muſt indite good matter,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 2. Cor. 4.13.</note> and then our tongues muſt be as the pen of a readie writer: we muſt firſt beleeue, and then wee muſt ſpeake. Thus then is this prayer abuſed by ignorant perſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">How impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons abuſe prayer.</note> the impenitent perſon though he haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo be freed from that kind of abuſe of this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet abuſeth it as bad, if not worſe, in another kinde: for</p>
            <p n="1">1. God heareth not them that liue in ſinne vnrepented of: for their prayers and ſacrifices,<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.18. Ioh. 9.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Prou. 15.8. Eſay. 1.</note> and all their ſeruice of God is abominable, and is no better than iniquitie it ſelfe in Gods ſight: for though God hath commanded prayer, and ſacrifice, and incenſe, as was accuſtomed in the old Teſtament, yet he required that they ſhould be offered by perſons that were meete and fit for that purpoſe: and ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18172:13"/> though God now require that wee ſhould pray, and heare the word, and communicate in the Sacraments, actions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the former of the old Teſtament, yet God will not accept theſe actions performed by any man: but firſt a man muſt leaue his ſins, and then pray: repent, and then heare the word, examine himſelfe and finde himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie before he eate: otherwiſe his praying, hearing and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are turned into ſinne. If then the prayer of an vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant perſon be abominable, if God heareth it not, if it bee iniquitie, ſurely the wicked man doth abuſe it and make it ſo: for God would accept that of vs which hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, if we would performe it as he requireth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, impenitent perſons abuſe prayer, becauſe they doe not practiſe that which they pray: for euery pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be practiſed: otherwiſe there is hypocriſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. For if a man pray that Gods name may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if hee by ſwearing vainly or falſely prophane the name of God, it is double dealing, for his heart and tongue accord not in one, nay his tongue contradicteth it ſelfe: for he asketh with the tongue that he may not diſhonor Gods name, and yet with a vaine or falſe oath his tongue doth diſhonour Gods name: this his tongue ſpeaketh contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: or elſe hee neuer meaneth to practiſe that which hee prayeth, and ſo his heart and tongue are at variance, which is hypocriſie: an impenitent perſon then doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe prayer, for that he neuer prayeth with his hart, though with his tongue he ſpeake it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Furthermore, the man that liueth in his ſinnes, which he repenteth not of, doth curtoll and (as I may ſo ſpeake) libbe this prayer, and ſo abuſe it: for if we pray this prayer aright, we muſt pray euery petition thereof: but an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent perſon cannot pray euery prayer therein contained: for a ſwearer cannot pray, hallowed be thy name; a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor cannot pray, thy kingdome come; the impatient perſon cannot pray, thy will be done; the couetous perſon cannot pray for his daily bread; and ſo foorth of the reſt: for how can they pray againſt thoſe ſinnes, wherein they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18172:13"/> haue reſolued with themſelues as it were to liue and die? And therefore if the miniſter or any other Chriſtian ſhall reproue them of thoſe ſeuerall ſinnes which they practiſe, they will hate him and perſecute him for it; which argueth plainely that they neuer pray againſt them, for they cannot abide to heare of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To end this point, they abuſe this prayer for that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in ſinne, notwithſtanding they take this prayer a part of holy ſcripture, and ſo Gods name in vaine; for they haue nothing to doe to meddle with Gods word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.16.</note> ſeeing they hate to be reformed, and caſt Gods word behinde them. For whereas they ſpeake this prayer to God they are neuer a whit bettered thereby, and ſo it is in vaine to them: alſo they vſe it without feare and reuerence, as euery part of holy Scripture ſhould bee vſed, and therefore abuſe it:<note place="margin">Eſa. 66.5.</note> whereby it appeareth euidently that wicked and hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and impenitent perſons that purpoſe to continue ſtil in their ſins, doe abuſe this prayer, though peraduenture they vnderſtand it, when they vtter it in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the papiſt alſo abuſeth this prayer and that three wayes eſpecially:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſay it in Latin, a tongue vnknowne to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſorte of people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſay it in number vpon their beades.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay it as ſatisfactory and meritorious.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt they abuſe it becauſe they ſay it in Latin,<note place="margin">How papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe prayer.</note> a tongue which for the moſt part is not vnderſtoode of them that ſay it, and hardly well pronounced by the multitude: but vnderſtanding is neceſſarily required in prayer,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.26.</note> as was ſaid before: and whereas the Ieſuites auouch that God vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth Latin or any language, and prayer is directed to God, and that inſtruction of the hearer is no end of prayer but of preaching: we anſwere that the Apoſtle ſaith flatly that all things muſt be done to edification: therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo, which is ſome thing, nay a chiefe and principal part of the publike ſeruice of God: hence we reade that the title of ſome of the pſalmes, which are prayers, is to giue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18172:14"/> inſtruction: as Pſal. 74. and 89. That therefore is but a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie of man contrarie to the word: for prayer is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes of edification, it being as a whetſtone to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the grace of God in vs; eſpecially if it proceed feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the heart and lips of the Miniſter, it doth rouze the drouſie ſpirits of dull Chriſtians: for there is no difference betwixt preaching and praying but this; that preaching is directed to men from God, prayer is directed from man to God, both preaching and prayer is the word of God, or ought to be ſo. Wherefore as preaching or reading the word are excellent meanes of edification and inſtruction; ſo likewiſe conceauing or reading prayer is a worthie meanes appointed of God to edifie the people of God, and prayer is a ſecond hammer, or a ſecond ſtroke with the hammer, to beate the naile to the head, that is to ſay, to faſten the holy doctrine, exhortation, admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, conſolation, or what elſe, deeper in the conſcience or vnderſtanding: and this is the edification of prayer. Therefore herein the Ieſuites are greatly miſtaken that they thinke inſtruction and edification no end of prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly our Sauiour Chriſt requireth, and it is the very ſumme of the firſt table of the law,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.5. Matth. 22.37. Luk. 10.27. Pſal. 103.1.</note> that we loue God with all our heart, our ſoule, our mind, our thought, our ſtrength; and all that is within vs muſt praiſe his holy name. But as was ſaid before, prayer is commaunded in the firſt table, and is therefore a part of loue we owe to God: hence then it followeth as a neceſſarie concluſion, that we muſt teſtifie that we loue God with our minde and with all our minde in prayer, when our minde is buſied about the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſideration of that holy matter which we vtter to God; but that cannot poſſiblie be, if wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what we ſpake, as they doe not that ſpeake their prayers in an vnknowne language as Latin: they therefore abuſe prayer that pray in Latin, not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Laſtly, as hath been ſaid, it is plaine babling to ſpeake any thing with the lips in the preſence of God, which a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18172:14"/> man vnderſtandeth not, or deſireth not in the heart and minde:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.20,</note> for we muſt glorifie God with the body and with the ſpirit both, for they are both Gods by creation and redemption: now to pray to God is a principall part of the glorifying of God; therefore we muſt pray with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as well as with the tongue, which is a part of the body. For whereas the ſchoolemen teach that actuall attention is not needefull in time of prayer, but it ſufficeth to come with a holy purpoſe to pray, it is as vaine a forgerie as the former of the Ieſuites that held inſtruction no end of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for whereas they alledge for confirmation of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that our heart is not in our owne power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not able to keepe it from wandering; ſurely we muſt needes graunt it to be ſo, and yet notwithſtanding it is ſinne for vs to ſuffer our hearts to wander: and who durſt goe ſpeake to his prince, his minde either not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his matter, or wandering from it, which in effect are all one? Wherefore if babling be abuſing of prayer, and they babble which vnderſtand not or attend not their prayers: no doubt they that ſay the Lords prayer in Latin, not vnderſtanding Latin, abuſe it. Thus then the papiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth this prayer by ſaying it in Latin, a tongue vnknowne to the people.</p>
            <p>Secondly the papiſts abuſe this prayer eſpecially, by ſaying it in number, and numbering it vpon their beades: and hence it is that they ſay a whole beadrole of prayers; as for example 30. prayers, <hi>Pater noſters, aue maries, creedes &amp;c.</hi> which will be proued to be a manifeſt abuſing of the Lords prayer. For firſt, this is to babble: for it cannot bee that euery mans deuotion ſhould laſt ſo long as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the prayers laſteth: for ſome weake Chriſtians fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie and zeale will not indure longer than the ſaying of the prayer twiſe or thriſe ouer: at which time he muſt ceaſe ſaying it; for if he ſtill continue ſaying it without fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie and deuotion and attention, in a word without ſenſe and feeling, his ſaying is babling, onely a liplabor, which is abominable in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="2">

               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.7. Eccleſ. 5.1.2.</note>2 Againe, our Sauiour Chriſt condemneth vaine repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and the wiſe Preacher requireth that our words ſhould be few, becauſe God is in heauen and we are vpon the earth: therefore we muſt not raſhly and haſtely huddle ouer ten or twentie prayers as a poſt horſe runneth his poſt miles; but if in any action, ſurely in this holy and reuerent action, the calling vpon Gods name, our prouerbe is true, Haſt makes waſte: for God is in heauen, that is to ſay, a heauenly God, moſt wiſe, moſt holy, moſt iuſt, moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and euery way moſt glorious, and therefore muſt be worſhipped after the beſt manner we can poſſibly afford: againe, we are vpon the earth, that is to ſay, men, duſt and aſhes, ſubiect to ſinne in the beſt actions, improuident and vnwiſe perſons, eſpecially in our affaires which are done ſodainely and haſtily: therefore we are not either with our heart to conceiue, or with our tongue to vtter a matter raſhly and ſpeedily before God, but we muſt be well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before hand, and in the action vſe al ſolemne decencie: but to racket ouer the Lords prayer ſo many times as they doe, is nothing elſe but as it were to toſſe it like a tenniſe ball, and to abuſe it ſhamefully. Now our Sauiour Chriſt doth not condemne al repetitions, nor the Preacher ſimply forbid many words: but ſuch repetitions and multitude of words as are vnreuerently, and without affection vttered, rather to perfect the number and hold out the time, than expreſſe the affection:<note place="margin">Dan. 9.19.</note> for repetitions and many words ſometimes proceede from an ardent and vehement deſire of obtaining ſomething, which men deſiring to haue, God doth, for reaſons beſt knowne to himſelfe, defer to graunt, and ſometimes to ſtirre vp our feruencie and try our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and perſeuerance.<note place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Againe, ſuch repetitions are needles in regard of God,<note place="margin">Act. 15.8.</note> for he knoweth our wants and requeſts at our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of them in our hearts, ſeeing he knoweth the heart: or before wee thinke of them, becauſe he knoweth our thoughts a farre off:<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.2.</note> much more then when we haue once vttered them, which God requireth not for that he needeth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18172:15"/> our ſpeech to tell him what we want, but for that we muſt worſhip him with the whole man, body as well as ſoule, and tongue as well as any other part of the body: yea the tongue is the principall part in Gods worſhip, therefore called the glory of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 57.8.</note> as the chiefe inſtrument of glorifying God: and as it is needles in regard of God to repeate ſo often, ſo in publike prayer it ſerueth not for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſeeing it wearieth the auditory; and in priuate prayer it wearieth him that vſeth it. Once therefore in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling faith and feruencie is better than ten times in coldnes, dulnes, wearines and ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the papiſts abuſe this prayer and that very ſtrangely, becauſe they ſay it in opinion of merit and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: for ſo the arch Ieſuite teacheth that there are three ends of prayer: namely, firſt obtaining, ſecondly merit, thirdly ſatisfaction: and that prayer doth not only obtaine but ſatisfie for ſinne, and meritoriouſly deſerue at Gods hands.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Now the truth is that as all our good workes are ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſinne, ſo eſpecially our prayers, which are the weakeſt ſeruice we can performe to God, and hath moſt corruption in it: as may appeare by the manifold wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoughts that haunt our mindes in the time of prayer, withdrawing our hearts from that due attention and reuerence we ought to haue: wherefore the wiſe man for the terror of wicked men ſaith, that the ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Prou. 15.8.</note> euen the beſt ſeruice of the wicked, is abomination to the Lord: but contrariewiſe the prayer, that is the weakeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, of the godly man is acceptable, which maketh very much for the comfort of euery diſtreſſed conſcience: now if our prayers be ſtained with ſo many corruptions, they cannot merit any thing except it be the puniſhment, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, ſeeing they are not proportionable thereunto, nay they neede a ſatisfaction to be made for them: wherefore euery true humbled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian finding the palpable experience hereof in his heart, crieth out with the prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2.</note>

            <p n="2">2 Beſides, all our prayers are to bee made in Chriſts name,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.23.</note> that is in the merit, mediation and interceſſion of Chriſt Ieſus: and therefore the prayers of the Saints muſt be performed with the ſmoke of the odours which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Angell,<note place="margin">Apoc. 8.3.4.</note> before they aſcend vp before God: for in Chriſt Ieſus God the Father is well pleaſed with vs,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.17.</note> and with all our holy actions: but out of Ieſus Chriſt he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with vs:<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if our prayers haue neede of Chriſts merit and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, how haue they any merit or ſatisfaction in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Laſtly, all the arguments that are vſed againſt the merits of good workes in generall, ſerue ſufficiently to ouerthrow the merit of prayers: and ſo to end this point, ſeeing the papiſts vſe prayer for other ends than it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they abuſe it; as when a man vſeth a ſword to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is appointed for iuſtice, he abuſeth the ſword. Thus we ſee how this prayer is abuſed by papiſts, ſaying it in Latin, in number, in opinion of merit and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How charmers abuſe prayer.</note>The fourth ſort of perſons that abuſe this prayer and others, are wiſe women, as they are termed, or good witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; which are termed good, not for that they doe good by witchcraft and doe no harme to their neighbours: theſe make the Lords prayer or other good prayers charmes: for by ſaying of prayers they can cure diſeaſes, driue away the toothach, heale things foreſpoken, &amp;c. Now that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is abuſed by them it is plaine.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God neuer appointed prayer to be a meanes to cure diſeaſes or ſuch like, being applied to the ſore or diſeaſe or atch: for although it be needefull that we pray to God for the remouing of paines and ſicknes from vs and ours; yet it doth not follow thereupon that God appointed prayer for a medicine, which being applied to diſeaſes ſhall cure
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18172:16"/> them: for then euery man would be a phyſition to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe whatſoeuer diſeaſe he had, by his prayers. Prayer doth ſanctifie phyſicke vnto vs, it is no phyſicke it ſelfe:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth at Gods hands a bleſſing vpon our medicines that they may cure vs; it ſelfe by vertue inherent in it doth not cure vs: and as our meates and drinke by vertue in them doe nouriſh our bodies, which notwithſtanding are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by prayer for that end: ſo phyſicke cureth our diſeaſes, prayer ſanctifieth phyſicke. Wherefore ſeeing prayer is not Catholicum as the phyſitions call ſome of their medicines, that is an vniuerſall medicine for all diſeaſes, nay no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine for any one diſeaſe, it followeth that theſe wiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that vſe it as a meanes to cure diſeaſes, abuſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> this was a miraculous gift in the time of the Apoſtles, whereunto was added vnction with oyle alſo; which continued in the Church but for a certaine ſeaſon, ſo long as the doctrine of the Church had neede of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie confirmation by miracle: now the doctrine of the Goſpell being ſufficiently confirmed by witnes ordinarie and extraordinarie, of God and man, this gift ceaſeth as all other miracles. Wherefore they that ſhall enterpriſe this miraculous courſe of curing ſicknes, what doe they elſe but challeng this miraculous gift: and what are they elſe but impoſters and ſeducers of the ignorant,<note place="margin">2.

            <p n="3">3 Beſides this, you ſhall obſerue theſe wiſe women, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and charmers will with writing the prayer cure the diſeaſes and aches of men. As for example, they will write it vpon a peece of paper: or hauing written it, cauſe the partie diſeaſed to weare it about his necke, and ſo they ſhall be cured: they will write it in cheeſe or vpon bread and giue it to mad dogges to eate, and their madnes ſhall depart from them: and other practiſes of like folly and impietie: all which plainely argue ſocietie and fellowſhip with the diuell, and the helpe of the diuell: for others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, but themſelues: and why I pray you cannot others doe it? forſooth ſay they, you doe not beleeue as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18172:17"/> we doe, no not though you ſay or write the ſame prayers that they doe. Surely wee beleeue that to be true which they ſay: for they haue either openly, or at the leaſt ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, contracted with the diuell, whoſe they are, whom they ſerue and honor; and in whom they beleeue. No maruaile then though others which worſhip the true God, cannot doe ſuch charming trickes as they can, for indeede good Chriſtians beleeue not in the diuell as they doe. Wherefore ſeeing they direct their prayers to the diuell, which ſhould be directed to God alone, they doe greatly abuſe their prayers.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. Firſt, it is a platforme of prayer.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, it is moſt excellent.</item>
               <item>3. Thirdly, it is moſt perfect and abſolute.</item>
               <item>4. Fourthly, it is onely a generall forme of prayer.</item>
               <item>5. Fiftly, it is hard to be vſed aright for a prayer.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:18172:21"/>
            <p>The firſt qualitie or propertie of this prayer is,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Lords prayer is a platf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rme of prayer. <hi>Matth. 6.9.</hi>
               </note> that as it is a prayer, ſo alſo and that more eſpecially it is a direction and platforme of prayer. For as a man going to build an houſe, will firſt haue a platforme or an idea in his head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording whereunto he will frame his houſe: ſo the Lords prayer is an idea or paterne whereby euery true prayer is framed: and as the holy Scriptures are termed Canonicall, for that they are the canon or rule of faith and manners; ſo the Lords prayer may bee called Canonicall, for that it is the canon or rule of all other prayers: for there is no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the holy Scripture but it may bee referred vnto this prayer: and all the prayers which haue been, are, or ſhall be made, muſt be meaſured by this prayer, and ſo far forth are they commendable and acceptable as they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereunto. For as a circle containeth al figures, a ſphere all bodies, and an infinite line all lines: ſo the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er containeth all prayers: reſembled to a map which at once to the view offreth the conſideration of al the world, ſo this is the ſynopſis of all prayers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond qualitie of this prayer is the excellencie thereof: for it is Gods word, a portion of holy Scripture.<note place="margin">The excellencie of the Lords pra er.</note> The prayers which wee make may be, and ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word, but Gods word they are not: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt excellent: for if all the men liuing in the world ſhould ſtudie all their daies to frame a prayer, they were not able to make a prayer comparable hereunto: Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the wiſedome of God framed it,<note place="margin">Luk. 11 49. &amp; 11.1.</note> and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely teaching how to pray: therefore excellent muſt that prayer bee which was framed by the excellencie of Gods wiſedome: and as there is no proportion betweene the finite and the infinite; ſo is there no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the infinite excellencie and capacitie of this prayer, and the prayers of all other men liuing.</p>
            <p>The third propertie of this prayer is the perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: other prayers are imperfect,<note place="margin">The perfection of the Lords prayer.</note> either for that they are ſtained with manifold wants and corruptions, as all our prayers are; or for that they containe but ſome portion of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18172:22"/> the matter contained in this prayer: as the prayers of holy men mentioned in the Scriptures. This prayer containeth the whole Scripture: for it is an Epitome or abridgement of the whole Scripture, a Catechiſme in forme of a prayer, containing all the vertues of the Law and Goſpell, and all the good we can pray for, all the graces and bleſſing wee can giue thankes for, all the euill we can pray againſt: and to theſe heads may the whole Scripture be referred.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Lords prayer a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prayer onely.</note>The fourth propertie of this prayer is, that it is onely a generall prayer or forme of prayer: for all the good things we want are not nominated here, nor all the euill wee pray againſt; yet they are here included, either ſimply and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as the ſpeciall in the generall, the part in the whole: or elſe figuratiuely and by proportion, as one part vnder another. For example ſake, prayer for health, patience, faith, the King, the Counſell, the Miniſter, the afflicted, &amp;c. are not here expreſſely named; yet they may euery one of them be referred to ſome one petition or more: therefore this generall prayer may be compared to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Articles of faith: to the Categories and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates in Logick, where the heads and generals are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded onely, or the chiefe or principall matters: the ſpeciall and leſſe principal are by proportion and diſcourſe of reaſon to be referred thereto, or reduced thence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Lords prayer hard to be vſed aright for a prayer.</note>The laſt qualitie or propertie of this prayer is, that it is very hard to vſe this prayer aright for a prayer. Now it is not denied but that it is a prayer, and may be vſed lawfully for a prayer: but to vſe it aright as it ought to be vſed, there is the difficultie. For the words of the prayer being ſo ſhort as they are, and the matter contained in the words both ſo large and diuers; euen as large and ample as all things we ſtand in need of and can pray for, as all things we can pray againſt, as all things we can giue thankes for: how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a man praying this prayer ſhould in any medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie with his minde conceiue, and his affections purſue the thouſand part of the things comprehended in this ſhort forme? eſpecially conſidering the vnſearchable depth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18172:22"/> of our Sauiour Chriſts conceipt, when he vttered this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; whereinto wee are in ſome meaſure to conueigh our conceipts in time of vſing it for a prayer; otherwiſe it will be the abuſing of it.</p>
            <p>Againe, it being a portion of holy Scripture very hard to be vnderſtood, &amp; being diuerſly by diuers perſons expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; alſo it being doubtfull which is the true expoſition thereof: if we perhaps light vpon a falſe expoſition, and ſo a falſe meaning of the words, we do not pray it aright as we ought to pray; for we muſt giue the ſame ſenſe vnto euery petition, which our Sauiour Chriſt gaue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did pray it; if we do otherwiſe we wreſt the prayer &amp; abuſe it: hence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeareth the difficultie of vſing it aright for a prayer.</p>
            <p>Out of the conſideration of this laſt propertie of this prayer ariſeth this conſectarie or concluſion: that there is leſſe daunger of ſinne in conceiuing a prayer agreeable to this prayer, than in vſing this prayer for a prayer; which may bee verified thus: when wee conceiue a prayer, wee know our owne meaning certainely; ſo doe wee not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely know the meaning of euery point in the Lords prayer: againe, when we pray we attaine the depth of the meaning of our owne words; ſo can we not poſſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the depth of the meaning of our Sauiour Chriſt, when he vſed theſe words: Finally, our words in prayer concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued are as large as our matter and affection; but here in the Lords prayer, the matter being as large as the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the words are ſcant the thouſand part thereof: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion and conſectarie is verified. To end this point then, although this be the moſt excellent and perfect platforme of prayer, and prayer, that euer was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed; yet conſidering that it is onely a generall prayer, and hard to be vſed aright, as Chriſt himſelfe vſed it, therefore it may ſeeme that a prayer conceiued according to this prayer, is as acceptable, if not more accepted of God, than this prayer: for though the Lords prayer is better than any other prayer, yet a man may, and can, and doth vſe his own conceiued prayer better than he can vſe the Lords prayer:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18172:23"/> and prayer is accepted or not accepted of God, according as it is rightly vſed or abuſed: and this is profitable for the ignorant people to thinke vpon, conſidering their intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abuſing of the Lords prayer. Thus much may ſuffice to haue ſpoken of the generall conſideration of the Lords prayer in the foreſaid three points, the abuſe, the vſe, and the conditions thereof.</p>

               <note place="margin">Specially of the Lords prayer.</note>Now it followeth, that we alſo conſider thereof ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>This prayer containeth three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The firſt is the perſons to be conſidered in prayer.</item>
               <item>2. The ſecond is the matter of prayer.</item>
               <item>3. The third is the manner of prayer.</item>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The perſons to be conſidered in prayer.</note>The perſons which are to be conſidered in prayer, are comprehended in that which is ordinarily termed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Lords prayer, or the compellation, contained in theſe words.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>All they are to pray that can call God father, or the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God brethren: <hi>Our Father.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>We are to pray to God onely, who is the Father of the creature, and our Father in Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are to pray in his name, who hath made God, of an enemie a friend, yea a father, that is Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of thoſe perſons that are to be conſidered in prayer, is who are to pray, which may be thus diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, who muſt pray: or who is bound to pray.</p>
            <p>Secondly, who may pray: or who may lawfully pray.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18172:23"/>
            <p>Thirdly, who can pray: or who can pray aright.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: all men muſt pray, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Who muſt pray.</note> all men are bound in conſcience to pray vnto God, for prayer is a morall precept, which bindeth all men, as all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God doe: for all the commaundements were written in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and that not onely for himſelfe, but for all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: wherefore the very gentils which knew not the law giuen by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> yet ſhew the effect of the law written in their hearts, when their conſciences accuſe them, or excuſe them. Seeing therefore that prayer is a commaundement of the morall law, and all the commaundements of the morall law binde the conſcience of all men to obedience, therefore all men muſt pray, otherwiſe they incurre the penaltie of the breach of the law, which is the euerlaſting curſe of God.</p>
            <p>Here it may be obiected concerning this and all the reſt of the commaundements, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
               </label> that all men are not bound to pray, or to keepe the law, ſeeing that it is impoſſible we ſhould keepe the law, or that all men ſhould pray: for God commaundeth not impoſſibilities, ſay the papiſts: ſeeing therefore it is impoſſible for all men to keepe the law, or to pray; all men therefore are not bound to pray, or all men muſt not pray.</p>
            <p>To this, anſwere may bee made by a diſtinction, <label type="milestone">

               </label> that things may be termed impoſſible two waies, either for that they are impoſſible in their owne nature, or for that they are impoſſible by accident or ſome outward occaſion: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of things impoſſible in their owne nature are theſe; that a ſtone of it owne accord ſhould moue vpward; that iron or leade of it owne accord ſhould ſwim vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not ſinke: examples of things impoſſible through accident, or by reaſon of ſome outward occaſion are theſe; that a man that hath his tongue cut out, ſhould ſpeake, or that hath his eyes put out, ſhould ſee: now the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the diſtinction anſwereth the obiection ſufficiently: Gods commaundements, and ſo the commaundement of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18172:24"/> prayer is not impoſſible to be performed of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for <hi>Adam</hi> was able to keepe it continuing in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of innocencie, wherein God had created him, and ſo all mankinde in <hi>Adam:</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſing, and all mankinde in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> by accident and occaſion, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God (and namely that of prayer) is become impoſſible vnto vs: we are not able to pay our debts, for we haue ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">

               </label> It is no hard dealing at all: for if the creditor may iuſtly require the debt of the debter, though he be not able to diſcharge it, or otherwiſe caſt him in priſon for default of payment; much more may God deale ſo with vs: either exact obedience of vs, or caſt vs in priſon till we pay the vtmoſt farthing: neither is there any reaſon that God ſhould change his righteous law, and ſquare it to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, no more than becauſe there are theeues and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, therefore the law that commaundeth ſuch perſons to be hanged, or puniſhed, ſhould be altered: the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſquareth his crooked timber to his rule, and he doth not frame his rule to his crooked wood; ſo we muſt frame our actions to Gods law, and Gods law muſt not yeelde to our corruptions. Wherefore prayer being one of Gods commaundements, all men therefore muſt pray, or are bound in conſcience to pray, though now it be impoſſible to pray aright.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the firſt point, who muſt pray.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVho may pray.</note>The ſecond followeth, which is, who may pray.</p>
            <p>Though the commaundement of prayer be directed to all men, and therefore all men are bound to pray: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there are ſome men which may not pray, for if they doe, their prayer is turned into ſinne. Incenſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18172:24"/> vnto me, ſaith the Lord by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.13. Pſal. 141.2. Pro. 15.8.</note> it is iniquitie: now in the old Teſtament incenſe was a type of prayer, and was commaunded by God as a part of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip: ſo alſo the ſacrifice of the wicked man is abominable, that is,<note place="margin">Pro. 28.9.</note> all the worſhip of the wicked (for the part is put for the whole) and yet God had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſacrifices: he that turneth his eare from hearing of the law, his prayer is abominable; and yet prayer is Gods commaundement: whence it is neceſſarily collected, that there are ſome ſects of men, who if they pray, ſinne in their prayer, and therefore though they muſt pray, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they may not pray: they are bound to pray, yet if they pray, they ſinne.</p>
            <p>Theſe two propoſitions ſeeme to be contradictorie: <label type="milestone">

               </label> and therefore cannot both be true, as nature it ſelfe teacheth: All men muſt pray: and this: Some men may not pray. How can theſe things agree?</p>
            <p>Here we ſee that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in another ſenſe, that ſinne is out of meaſure ſinfull: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
               </label> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> ſinne peruerteth the whole order of nature, cauſeth contradictorie propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to be both true; for certaine it is that all men are bound in conſcience to pray, and therefore muſt pray; and this is certaine alſo, that all men may not pray; for if they doe, they ſinne and breake the law of God. Now the Lord of his goodnes hath found out a meanes to diſſolue this abſurditie, and breake the contradiction: wherefore he commaundeth to repent and forſake our ſinnes, and then to pray. And here we may note into what an intricate labyrinth or maze, ſinne hath brought mankinde, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of three bywaies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt pray that we may keepe the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,</p>
            <p>Secondly, we liuing in our ſinnes muſt not pray, leſt wee tranſgreſſe the third commaundement.</p>

               </gap>ly, we muſt repent (and that is a thing altogether impoſſible to fleſh and blood) before we pray aright. We being thus included in the maze, the Lords ſheweth vs the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18172:25"/> way out by the power of his ſpirit in the preaching of his word, working repentance in the hearts of his children that they may pray aright, and ſo all his commaundements are made eaſie vnto vs, which before were impoſſible; and ſo that ſentence of the Father is verified: <hi>da quod iubes, &amp; iubes quod vis:</hi> giue me power to doe thy commaundements, and then commaund what ſeemeth good vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo the ſecond point is handled, who may pray.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVho can pray.</note>The third is, who can pray, or who can pray aright?

But for the further cleering of this point, a diſtinction is to be admitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene three things, which the world thinketh either to be all one, or very neere of kindred: namely, firſt ſaying a prayer, ſecondly wiſhing a prayer, thirdly praying a praier.</p>

               <note place="margin">VVhat it is to ſay a prayer.</note>For the firſt, we muſt remember that all men can ſay prayers; there is not any man ſo ignorant, ſo impenitent, or ſo wicked, but he can and doth ſometime ſay his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and this is no better than the prating of a parret in Gods eares.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVhat it is to wiſh a prayer.</note>Secondly, to wiſh prayers is one thing, and to pray is another: for a wiſh is a ſodaine, earneſt, wandering, inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire of hauing ſomething, which a man either greatly regardeth not, or is not perſwaded to obtaine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVhat it is to pray a prayer.</note>Thirdly, a prayer is a continuall, ſetled, ordered, and feruent deſire of obtaining that which a man both greatly prizeth, and is perſwaded in ſome meaſure he ſhall haue.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A wiſh is ſodaine, as a flaſh of lightning, or the ſtay of a ball caſt at a wall, which reboundeth backe ſo ſoone as it toucheth: ſo a wiſh quickly ſhineth in the affection and by and by is extinct; but a prayer is continuall, which doth ſo poſſeſſe the heart that a man neither can nor will be voyded of it; hence we reade of ſome that prayed all night.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A wiſh is earneſt and vehement out of meaſure, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in temporall bleſſings, when the affection is caried as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18172:25"/> it were with a whirlewind for the preſent; yet in ſpirituall matters, there is an exceeding great coldnes and froſt of affection, but a prayer is feruent in ſpirituall matters, and moderate elſe where: yea and in ſpirituall matters, there is not that ſnatching vehemencie in prayer, as in wiſhes, but rather a ſober and moderate equability permanent and increaſing.</p>
            <p>A wiſh is wandering and rouing, for a wicked man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> would haue that he wiſheth, howſoeuer he come by it, whether by hooke or crooke he care not; and therefore when he wiſheth his heart is not ſet vpon God, nor knit vnto him: hence it commeth to paſſe that his wiſhes are either wicked, euen the tranſgreſſion of the tenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, or elſe God muſt worke wonders for the graunting of them: as hee will wiſh to haue a thouſand pound land by the yeare: here there is a ſecret implication either of iniurie to ſome man from whom it muſt be had, he coueting another mans goods; or elſe God muſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly create ſo much new earth or ſpace of ground in the world, &amp;c. But a prayer is ſetled and grounded vpon God and his word: hauing patience and expiration, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods leaſure without the aforeſaid rouing and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agate wiſhes.</p>
            <p>A wiſh is inordinate, for the wicked man he neither will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> vſe the meanes to obtaine that he wiſheth, nor referre the thing wiſhed to the right end: for example, a wicked man may wiſh heauen, but he wil neuer vſe the meanes to come to heauen, as <hi>Balaam;</hi> he may wiſh to haue the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> but he would haue vſed or rather abuſed them to his owne gaine, and he would haue bought them with money. But the prayer of the godly man is ordered aright intending Gods glory, the good of others, his owne edification, carefully vſing the good meanes which God hath ſanctified for that purpoſe: hence it is that <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith that many aske and receiue not,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.3.</note> ſeeing they aske amiſſe for the ſatisfying of their luſts.</p>
            <p>A wicked man ſometime wiſheth grace by fits, but he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:18172:26"/> doth not greatly ragarde it: therefore it is with him as with a woman that longeth for ſome vnholeſome thing, as tar, &amp;c. deſiring it eagerly for a fit, and afterward abhorring it: but the godly man he prayeth and prizeth grace inualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for obtaining whereof he will ſell all that he hath, and ſeparate himſelfe to ſeeke it,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.44. Pro. 18.1.</note> and occupie himſelfe in all wiſedome.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A wicked man wiſheth, but hath no aſſurance to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; for his wiſhes are driuen away with de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire, as the duſt by the winde: but the godly man prayeth, and ſaith in ſome meaſure with the man in the Goſpell, <hi>I beleeue, Lord helpe my vnbeliefe.</hi> Thus wee ſee how a wiſh differeth from a prayer: and that there is a great diſtance betweene wiſhing a prayer, and praying a prayer; and that they onely can pray that are qualified as is aforeſaid. And thus we ſee who are to pray.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">For whom we muſt pray.</note>The ſecond ſorte of perſons to bee conſidered in our prayers, are, for whom we are bound to pray: the ſumme of the doctrine, that concerneth this ſecond ſort of perſones, ſhall be comprehended in certaine propoſitions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof ſome are affirmatiue, ſome negatiue: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions affirmatiue are theſe ſixe enſuing.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we are to pray for all the elect, that as yet do not actually beleeue nor repent: and theſe two propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are confirmed vnto vs by the example of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.</note> who hath gone before vs in the practiſe of them both; though he prayed in another kinde, namely as the onely Mediator of redemption and interceſſion betwixt God and vs: his prayer being ſatisfactory and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; ours onely dutifull and charitable.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we are to pray for all the members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, whom in the iudgement of charitie we are to account Saints by calling:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.7.</note> ſo the Apoſtle writing to the Romanes in his ſalutation prayeth for them.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:18172:26"/>
            <p>Fourthly, we are to pray for all men, that is, for all ſorts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or ſtates and conditions of men,<note place="margin">1.

For although wee muſt not pray with them, as being perſons out of the communion of Saints: yet nature bindeth vs to pray for them, they being of our owne fleſh; and we know not how God hath diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them for their finall and futuer eſtate: and it may be that our prayers ſhall be meanes of obtaining at Gods hands remiſsion of their ſinnes, and their conuerſion and ſaluation, as it is probable <hi>Steuens</hi> prayer did further <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion.</p>
            <p>Sixtly and laſtly, we muſt pray for our very enemies that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> wiſh euill vnto vs, and deuiſe miſchiefe againſt vs:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.44.

               <note place="margin">1.

            <p>Thus negatiuely alſo we vnderſtand for whom wee are not to pray:<note place="margin">Againſt whom we may pray.</note> onely there remaineth this point neere vnto the former, againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may pray, which being ſhortly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18172:27"/> handled, this ſecond ſort of perſons alſo is limited.</p>
            <p>Generally therefore we may pray againſt al the enemies of our ſaluation: abſolutely againſt the diuell, the world, the fleſh, and all reprobates, whether ſinning the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holie Ghoſt, or otherwiſe, if they may bee knowne. Alſo we may pray againſt wicked men, theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obſerued.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that our prayer be <hi>in concreto, non in abſtracto,</hi> as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Logicians ſpeake: that is to ſay, we muſt direct our prayer not againſt the creature of God, but againſt the creature corrupted with ſinne and rebelling againſt God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in our prayers wee are not to intend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the creature which God hath made, but the execution of iuſtice in the deſerued puniſhment of ſinne, which is the will of God moſt righteous and iuſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee muſt take heede that our owne priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bee not the motioner of our prayers: for wee muſt not ſeeke to auenge our ſelues; but the cauſe of God and of the Church, which are matters publike, ought to ſtirre vs vp in imprecation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe wee know not what God hath decreed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of them, finally wee muſt alwaies remember to pray diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butiuely and conditionally: as for example thus: If they appertaine to thy election, conuert them, and in the meane time repreſſe them: if not, confound them. Thus the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon, for whom we are to pray, is diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The third perſon to be conſidered in prayer, is, through whom, or in whoſe name we are to pray: and that is in the name and through the mediation and interpoſition (that I may ſo ſpeake) of Ieſus Chriſt, who doth mediate our cauſe with the Father. And here two points are to be remembred and handled. The one is affirmatiue or poſitiue: wee muſt pray in Chriſts name. The other is excluſiue, containing in it a negatiue: we muſt pray in Chriſts name onely, and not in the name of any other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee are generally to remember that the name of Chriſt ſignifieth Chriſts merit, mediation, redemption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18172:29"/> are relatiue between perſon and perſon: for example ſake, the Father ſeated and ſent the Sonne into the world, the Sonne was ſent of the Father: the Father did not ſend the holy Ghoſt to take our nature: neither did the holy Ghoſt take our nature, but the Sonne onely. So in the caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: the Father doth not make interceſſion with the Sonne, but the Sonne maketh interceſſion with the Father: ſo neither doth the holy Ghoſt. For neither the Father nor the holy Ghoſt were incarnate, ſuffered or merited for vs, but the Sonne onely. The Father accepteth our prayers: the holy Ghoſt teacheth vs to pray, which is called interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.26. but in a generall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Sonne onely meriteth and deſerueth and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our prayers, hauing onely aſſumed our nature, and therein merited and prayed and obtained.

            <p>A. Becauſe he is ſufficiently qualified for the purpoſe, both for that he is iuſt, hauing perfectly fulfilled the law: and he is alſo a propitiation for our ſinnes, or ſuſtaining the puniſhment and meriting for vs: ſo that by this Scripture it is manifeſt that the perſon which is fit to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for vs, muſt alſo haue abilitie to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes: which power, becauſe it is not incident to the Angels, therefore the Angels are excluded from this office of interceſſion.</p>

            <p>For Chriſts interceſſion is deſeruing and meritorious: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but the interceſſion of the Angels and Saints is onely duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and charitable.</p>

            <p>Firſt, that we muſt pray to God: ſecondly we muſt pray to him onely.</p>

               </note> ſauing that we reade in the booke of Daniel that there was an act made that no man ſhould pray to any God for the ſpace of thirtie dayes, but to the King onely: this act the Princes made againſt religious <hi>Daniel</hi> in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, through flattery accompliſhing their murtherous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: but this was only a mouths atheiſme.

            <p>Leauing this firſt point, we deſcend to the ſecond,<note place="margin">VVe muſt pray to God alone.</note> That our prayers are to be directed to God alone; which may be confirmed by two reaſons: the firſt reaſon is the words of Chriſt alledged out of <hi>Moſes:</hi>

               <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue:</hi> which ſentence affoordeth this argument: that ſeeing prayer is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, therefore it is due to him onely: for to him only we muſt pray, whom we muſt worſhip and ſerue: but we muſt onely worſhip and ſerue God; therefore to God onely we muſt pray: now if that thredbare or motheaten diſtincttion of <hi>Latria, Dulia</hi> and <hi>hyperdulia</hi> be ſtill obiected, as though <hi>dulia</hi> and <hi>hyperdulia</hi> might be giuen to Saints, and the Virgin; but <hi>latria</hi> onely to God: the anſwere will euince, that by comparing of <hi>Matthew</hi> with <hi>Moſes, latria</hi> and <hi>dulia</hi> are all one: for the Hebrew word <hi>Gnabad,</hi>

            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:18172:31"/>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, therefore followeth which may be collected out of the Apoſtles word:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
               <hi>how ſhall they call vpon him on whom they haue not beleeued,</hi> which may be framed thus: To him only we muſt pray on whom we beleeue, but we onely beleeue in God; therefore we muſt only pray to God: for ſeeing prayer hath two parts, deſire, and faith, if faith be wanting, prayer is imperfect. Now I doe ſuppoſe that there is no papiſt dare ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may truſt in the Saints or Angels, which were fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Furthermore, this fourth perſon, to whom we muſt make our prayers, which is God, is expreſſed vnto vs two waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt by a name of relation, in that he is intituled <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>

Now as I coniecture, for that Chriſt did both pray it, and preſcribed it to others for a forme of prayer, therefore I incline to thinke that there is a compound meaning of the word, ſignifying both the firſt perſon in Trinitie, and the whole Trinitie; which affordeth vs this inſtruction: That when we pray we are ſo to direct our prayers to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that we do not exclude the other perſons of Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who with the Father are equally to be worſhipped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </note> and he rendreth a reaſon in that place; becauſe they ſaw nothing when the law was deliuered: and therefore the practiſe of many now adayes is reprouealbe, who, though they will not paint God, yet they paint two hands giuing the two tables, one to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and another to <hi>Aaron:</hi> which is falſe, monſtrous, and idolatrous: falſe, becauſe the tables were giuen onely to <hi>Moſes;</hi> monſtrous, becauſe there are hands without a body; idolatrous, becauſe there are hands, whereas God hath no ſhape at all, any way ſenſible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although in the holy Scripture figuratiuely there are hands, armes, feete, face, eares, and other manly parts attributed to God, yet we muſt not thinke that God hath any of theſe parts properly: indeede God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing anſwerable to theſe parts, or rather ſomething whereunto theſe parts in the creatures are ſutable: for God made man not onely according to his image, which conſiſteth in holines and righteouſnes, but alſo according to his ſimilitude (for the words may aptly be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) ſo that man is a ſimilitude of God: Gods armes and hands, and fingers, argue his power and actiuitie; his feete argue his vbiquitie; his face, eyes, and eares, declare his wiſedome and fauour, &amp;c. and proportionable to theſe attributes of God, there is a configuration of the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body in man, wherein man is like God:<note place="margin">Pſal 115.</note> wherefore we may ſay, and ſo we muſt conceiue of God, contrarie to the gods of the heathen: <hi>They haue eyes and ſee not;</hi> but God ſeeth, and yet he hath no eyes: <hi>they haue feete and walke not;</hi> but God walketh euery where, and yet hath no feete: and ſo of whatſoeuer other part may be

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we muſt conceiue of God as he hath reuealed himſelfe in his word and workes: namely, moſt mightie, iuſt, mercifull, wiſe, true, holy, ſimple, and euery way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, eternal, and bleſſed Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier, and Sauiour of all his creatures, &amp;c.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we muſt ſo direct our prayers to one perſon, as that we doe not exclude the other; for that is idolatrie to diuide the perſons, which are onely diſtinct.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, for order ſake we muſt pray to the Father direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and primarily; and that through the merit and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sonne, with the inſtinct and inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt: yet it is not vnlawfull to direct our prayers to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">2.

            <p>This may ſerue for the title, Father.

            <p>Secondly, if wee ſeriouſly weigh with our ſelues that God knoweth the inward diſpoſition of the ſoule; that he ſearcheth the hearts,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.13.</note> and trieth the reines; and that the bowels of the ſoule are ſeene of him, and requireth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſeruice of vs,<note place="margin">Iob. 4.24.</note> himſelfe being a ſpirit, it will work in vs religious feare and reuerence with ſinceritie, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pride, raſhnes, and diſſembling with God.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:18172:34"/>
            <p>Thirdly, if wee conſider with our ſelues the wonderfull attributes of God, as his heauenly omnipotencie, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite iuſtice, his incomprehenſible Maieſtie, and glorie euery way infinite; it may cauſe in vs rather aſtoniſhment and horror, than a bare and naked feare.</p>
            <p>But of this doctrine ariſeth a reproofe of their practiſe that come into Gods preſence,<note place="margin">A reproofe of carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and thoughts in time of Prayer. <hi>Eccleſ. 4.17.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> when wee come to talke with God, who is in the midſt of the fire.</p>
            <p>Others there are, more vile and baſe in their eſtimations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who bring before God the price of a dogge,<note place="margin">Vile and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thoughts reprooued.</note> or of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot: for this is the practiſe of many, who come to pray as the theefe to ſteale, the drunkard to the Ale, the leacher to the ſtewes: or as men that come from ſtealing, drinking and whoring: for when they haue wearied themſelues with theſe ſinnes, then they drop out of the ſtewes or Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe into the Church to prayer: theſe men ſay as the Prieſts and people ſaid in the Prophet <hi>Malachies</hi> time,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7.8.13.</note> 
               <hi>The table of the Lord is not to be regarded:</hi> wherefore before we appeare before the Lord, ſome time muſt bee ſpent in preparing our hearts to prayer,<note place="margin">Preparitiue before Prayer needfull.</note> that all carnall and fleſhly affections may be ſet apart, and wee throughly poſſeſſed with an honourable and reuerent regard of that holy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18172:35"/> wherefore the Prophet exhorteth the true <hi>Iacob</hi> or <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to lift vp the heads of the euerlaſting doores, that is,<note place="margin">Pſa. 24.6.7.</note> the cogitations and affections of the ſoule which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, that Chriſt the King of glorie may come in; for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall and worldly thoughts and deſires doe barre and lock the doore againſt him. And in the next Pſalme the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himſelfe practiſeth his exhortation (like a good Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher) lifting vp his ſoule vnto the Lord when hee ſpeaketh vnto him in prayer:<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.1.</note> for ſeeing we pray to God our Father which is in heauen and heauenly, therefore wee muſt haue heauenly affections and meditations in time of prayer. Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.21.</note> where our treaſure is there will our hearts be: If God bee our treaſure who is in heauen, our hearts and mindes will be there alſo: wherefore wee muſt pitch our affections on things which are aboue, and not on things which are below:<note place="margin">Colloſ. 3.2. <hi>VVanderings reprooued.</hi>
               </note> ſo that here falleth to the ground all wauing and gadding thoughts and deſires in time of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, beſides or contrarie to the matter vttered in prayer: as about our dinner, our money, our cattell, our pleaſures, our ſuites and aduerſaries, and a thouſand of like qualitie: ſo that if our prayers were written as wee conceiue them, and our by-thoughts as parentheſes interlaced, they would be ſo ridiculous, as that wee might very well bee aſhamed of them: and yet alas God muſt haue ſuch prayers of vs, or he muſt haue none; for wandrings will creepe into the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the moſt godly and vigilant, though in time of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they watch their hearts with double diligence: which ineuitable infirmities being diſliked and bewailed, ſhall not be imputed to Gods children.</p>
            <p>And thus the fourth affection, <hi>viz.</hi> reuerence, is requiſite, by occaſion whereof the fifth holy diſpoſition alſo hath been handled, which is (as hath been ſaid) heauenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and affections, ſeuered from the world and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters. Now therefore the ſixth and laſt of theſe holie diſpoſitions is Faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>6.</hi> Of Faith.</note> which is grounded vpon the former foundation: for ſeeing God is our Father, therefore wee may be aſſured of his loue; and ſeeing hee is in heauen or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18172:35"/> heauenly, we need not doubt of his power;<note place="margin">Foure grounds of faith, loue, power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, truth of God.</note> and ſeeing he is ſo in heauen as that hee is euery where elſe (as hath been ſaid) wee may bee ſufficiently perſwaded of his preſence: adde hereto his truth and fidelitie, which will aſſure vs of performing his promiſes, and wee may haue full aſſurance of faith: which may thus be ſingled out.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, God is euery where, and ſo knoweth our wants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, God is powerfull and omnipotent, and ſo able to doe whatſoeuer he will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, God is louing and mercifull, and therefore hath will to doe for vs what is beſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, God is true, and therefore performeth his promiſes, and keepeth his fidelitie for euer. So that if theſe meditations frequent our mindes, our faith will maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly bee confirmed, which is thus grounded out of this preface. And theſe are the perſons &amp; affections of prayer.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus diſcuſſed the preface, which is the firſt part of the Lords prayer: now it followeth in like manner to intreate of the petitions, which are the ſecond part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and may bee termed the matter of prayer:<note place="margin">The matter of this prayer.</note> in handling whereof generally this method ſhall be obſerued.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the petitions are propounded by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in due order, ſome firſt, and ſome laſt;<note place="margin">Rules for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the petitions.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reaſon of this order ſhall be ſearched out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that the words of ſome or all the petitions are doubtfull, therfore the ſenſe and meaning of the words in the next place is to be ſcanned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſeeing the words of euery petition are ſo ſhort, the contents are alſo to be obſerued: for better inuention whereof, cerraine rules muſt be remembred.</p>
            <p>Whereof the firſt is, that ſeeing the petitions are as the Commandements, certaine generall heads, or places,<note place="margin">Rules for the contents of each petition.</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpecials are to be referred, or elſe ſome ſpeciall put for the reſt, therefore a particular enumeration will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of ſuch matters, as by Rhetoricall diſcourſe may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: and here the figure <hi>Synecdoche</hi> and <hi>Metonymia</hi> haue ſpeciall vſe in moſt of the petitions.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:18172:36"/>
            <p>A ſecond rule is, that where good things are prayed for, euill things of the ſame kinde, as the hinderances and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of the good, are prayed againſt: and ſo the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions containe ſupplications, and deprecations.</p>
            <p>A third rule alſo is, that ſeeing this prayer is a perfect platforme of prayer or inuocating of God, therfore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie there muſt place of thankfulnes be had in this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and hereupon it followeth, that in each petition, as we pray for good things, ſo we giue thankes for them: and as wee pray againſt euill, ſo wee giue thankes for immunitie and preſeruation from euill.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fiue things to be conſidered in euery peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               </note>Hence therefore it followeth, that in euery petition fiue things are to be conſidered: which are theſe following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the order of the petitions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſenſe and meaning of the words of each petition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the good things we aske, called ſupplication.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the euill we pray againſt, called deprecation.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the good wee giue thankes for, which is either in bleſſings conferred, or euill preuented, called thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>Out of which conſideration appeareth alſo the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vſing the words of the Lords prayer for a prayer: namely,<note place="margin">The difficultie of vſing the Lords Prayer aright.</note> for that it is an inſtrument for ſeuerall purpoſes oppoſed each to other: as for good and againſt euill: in asking and praiſing, and that in euery petition: ſo that we had neede vſe great leiſure in vttering the words, deep me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in ſearching out the contents, and contrarie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in reſpect of contrarie obiects, good and euill, and ſo foorth: or elſe very likely wee ſhall in no mediocritie diue into the depth of the matters therein contained: and yet neuertheleſſe I thinke it may lawfully bee vſed for a prayer, for ought that I yet conceiue. Theſe things being generally prefixed, as materiall for the vnderſtanding of each petition, it remaineth that we deſcend to a particular diſcuſſing of them: and firſt they admit this diſtinction: Some of them reſpect God ſimply and meerely: others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18172:36"/> vs alſo: now theſe prayers which concerne God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and ſimply, without any reſpect of vs, are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded firſt of all: the reaſon whereof is diuers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that God is the abſolute Lord of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and hee muſt abſolutely bee regarded, all reſpect of our ſelues ſet apart: wherefore, if wee wanting our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread, and remiſſion of ſinnes, God thereby might gaine glorie, we ought to be content therewith. Hence we ſee how vehemently Gods children haue bin carried with fierie zeale of Gods glorie:<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.17. 1. King 19.14. Exod. 33.31. Rom. 9.3.</note> The zeale of Gods houſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Chriſt, famiſhed <hi>Elias,</hi> and vrged the Prophet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to reiect his owne ſaluation; and cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> to wiſh himſelfe <hi>Anathema:</hi> or at leaſt to be content ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God in creating the world intended his owne glorie, which was the firſt and chiefe end;<note place="margin">Pro. 16.4.</note> and all other things, all Gods creatures and ordinances are but meanes to that end, as our daily bread, remiſſion of ſinne, ſtrength againſt temptation, Chriſt himſelfe the Mediatour, with all his workes and ſufferings, the Goſpell, Magiſtracie, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, the creatures and whatſoeuer elſe: that therefore which was firſt in Gods intention, muſt alſo bee firſt in our intention, if we be zealous of his glorie aright.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods glory, kingdome, and will are moſt deere to himſelfe, he loueth them as he loueth himſelfe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee will be like God, and approue our ſelues to bee the ſonnes of our heauenly father, and his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, wee muſt loue and procure, and further that which God our Father and Maſter prizeth ſo highly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God will be honoured, his kingdome ſhall be enlarged, and his will ſhall be fulfilled, let all the men and diuels in the world ſtriue to the contrarie neuer ſo long or ſo much. Wherefore it is better for vs voluntarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſeruiceable to his glorie, kingdome, and will, than by reſiſting to take the foyle, and procure iudgement to our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Gods glorie is the end of the creatures creation, and all the vnreaſonable creatures in the world aime at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18172:37"/> this end:<note place="margin">Pſal. 148.</note> wherefore the Prophet exhorteth all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of all kindes; and mankinde of all ages and ſexes, by neceſſarie conſequence of an argument from the leſſer to the greater, to laud and praiſe God. True it is that men and Angels of all the creatures are onely are irregular and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the end of our creation, wherein we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the bruite beaſt that periſheth:<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.20.</note> we are the end of the vnreaſonable creatures, and God is the end of man: wherefore as the creature is ſeruiceable to vs; ſo ought we alſo to be to God: for becauſe we are rebellious to God, the creature prooueth rebellious to vs.</p>
            <p>Thus we vnderſtand the reaſon of this order, which the holy Ghoſt vſeth in the petitions, preferring God before our ſelues, as reaſon requireth; which inſtructeth vs many waies. Frſt, to the deniall of our ſelues, which is the maine doctrine of mortification; the full meaſure whereof, is the perfection of Chriſtianitie, which conſiſteth both in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is continually to reſolue to part with all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to deny the truth, or to offend God; and in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.26.</note> which is the confeſſion of the truth vnto death: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in the Goſpell teacheth, that he is not worthie to be his Diſciple, that doth not in affection at the leaſt, and reſolution intend ſo to doe: viz. to forſake father and mother, wife and children, liuing and life it ſelfe for Chriſts ſake:<note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> for he muſt be our beſt beloued, as we are his, and therefore his honor and praiſe muſt ſpecially be intended and procured; which cannot be, if we loue any thing more than him: wherefore this order inſinuateth this ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, which is oppoſed to ſelfe-loue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this order teacheth zeale to Gods glory, for procuring whereof we are to ſpend our ſelues, and all we haue. The light account wherof deſerueth a very ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.21. Matth. 24.12.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine, propheſieth of a great haile, which like talents ſhall fall from heauen vpon men: and Chriſt he propheſieth, that becauſe iniquitie ſhall abound, the loue of men ſhall waxe colde: this colde haile and colde loue is now apparant in the world: it is marueilous to ſee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18172:37"/> how furiouſly the world flameth with contention about worldly profits and preferments, and yet how frozen their affections are to the obedience of Gods will, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of his kingdome, and the aduancement of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: whereas indeede the zeale of Gods glory ſhould ſo poſſeſſe vs, as that in compariſon thereof our care for daily bread ſhould occupie a very meane place.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this order teacheth vs the end of our daily bread, remiſſion of ſinne, and ſtrength in temptation, namely the obedience, kingdome, and glory of God: for to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe doth God beſtow vpon vs riches, honor, gifts, and graces, that we might imploy them to the beſt aduantage of God who gaue them. The rich man muſt ſo vſe his wealth, as that thereby God may gaine glory: the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonage muſt account it his chiefe honor to honor God: the man of learning, and ſpeech, and counſell in like manner; and ſo forth of the reſt.<note place="margin">Exod. 22.29. Leuit. 27.30. &amp; 32.</note> Hence it is that in the olde Teſtament, the Lord requireth the tenth of all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, whether of the earth, or of cattell, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his worſhip; which by proportion muſt alſo be enlarged to whatſoeuer God beſtoweth vpon vs; as the tenth of our learning, honor, wit, children, and the reſt, if they were increaſeable, and communicable: but beeing otherwiſe, the Lord requireth and accepteth that which may bee had, a carefull imployment of them all, to the further enlarging of his praiſe in the world. This may ſuffice in generall for the order of the petitions. Now more ſpecially, the petitions which concerne God ſimply, and meerely admit this diſtribution: for they reſpect either the end or the meanes procuring the end: Gods glory, mentioned in the firſt petition, is the end: the kingdome and will of God, mentioned in the ſecond and third peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are the meanes procuring the end: for God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified when his kingdome is aduanced, and his will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1 The order of this petition.</note>The firſt thing to be obſerued in this prayer is the order
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18172:38"/> why the end is before the meanes, why Gods glory is firſt prayed for, ſeeing that the meanes are in nature before the end: for it is impoſſible that God ſhould be glorified, except his kingdome come, and his will be done: and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aduancing of his kingdome, and the obedience of his wil, his glory is purchaſed. The reaſon of this order is to be fetcht from the Lords predeſtination, and the Churches intention: for the Lord in his eternall counſell firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded his glory, vttering as it were this euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in the firſt place: <hi>viz.</hi> I wil be glorified by the creature: this being ſet downe, the Lord in the next place predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth the meanes whereby this end muſt be atchieued: &amp; thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vttereth this ſecond decree: <hi>viz.</hi> I will aduance my kingdome, and cauſe my ſubiects to obey my will, that by this meanes I may be glorified by them. And as this is the order of Gods predeſtination, ſo Gods glory is firſt in the Churches intention, who in all their actions and endeuors propound Gods glory, whether it bee eating or drinking &amp;c. they doe all to the praiſe of God.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> Which is the inſtruction that ariſeth from this order; whence this exhortation is to be deduced to all ſorts of perſons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the publike officer of the common-wealth, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church, or the priuate man: the Magiſtrate ſo ought to gouerne, as Gods glory may beſt be procured: and not to adminiſter iuſtice for rewards,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.23.</note> or of affection, whereby it ſometime falleth out that the iuſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man hath his righteouſnes taken from him, and the wicked and vngodly are iuſtified, and ſo Gods honor is obſcured.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Thus much for the order of this petition.<note place="margin">2 Senſe of the firſt petition.</note> The next is the ſenſe and meaning of the words: they containe two things: firſt, the action: ſecondly, the obiect where about the action is conuerſant or occupied: the action apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to vs; the obiect of which action is the Lords; for we muſt ſanctifie, and his name muſt be ſanctified: Gods name is any thing whereby he is knowne vnto man,<note place="margin">VVhat Gods name ſinifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> as one man is knowne vnto another by his name; for in the firſt inſtitution of names, whereof mention is made in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the creation; euery creature had his name out of his eſſence or eſſentiall properties;<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.19.20.23.</note> as is very probable by the impoſition of the name to the woman who is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Hebrue of her matter, as <hi>Adam</hi> alſo had his name by God of his matter: the earth being the matter of the man, the man of the woman. So then although God is not nor cannot be knowne of vs by his eſſence, yet he may be knowne of vs by his properties and actions, which may be conceiued and ſeene of vs in ſome meaſure. Now the things whereby God is knowne, are his workes,<note place="margin">Gods vvorkes are his name.</note> and his word; his workes manifeſt vnto vs diuers things of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth; namely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom. 1.20.</hi> Gods vvord is his name. <hi>Ioh. 5.39.</hi>
                  </note> his eternall power and God-head: but his word doth fully and ſufficiently diſcouer whatſoeuer is needful for vs to know of God: and that which is darkely and imperfectly ſhrouded as it were vnder a curtaine in the creature, the ſame cleerely and throughly is expoſed to the view of all thoſe that will ſearch the Scripture:<note place="margin">Gods titles are his name.</note> now Gods word doth deſcribe God generally by titles and attributes. His titles are ſuch as partly teach what God is not, as infinit, immutable, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, inuiſible, incomprehenſible, and ſuch like: partly teach what God is, as God, Lord, <hi>Iah, Iehouah, Elohim.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Maſter, King, Creator, Preſeruer, Redeemer, Iuſtifier, Sanctifier, Sauiour, &amp;c. Whereof the latter are affirmatiue,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18172:39"/> teaching ſomething of God; the former are negatiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing ſomething from God. Theſe are the Lords titles. Gods attributes are in like manner,<note place="margin">Gods attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are his name.</note> his name; as his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Wiſedome, Mercie, Truth, Goodnes, and ſuch like; which doe not import in God any qualitie or accident; howſoeuer the reſemblance of them in vs are onely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, in God his wiſedome is himſelfe, and ſo of the reſt. Yet theſe attributes teach vs many things of God: his workes are nothing elſe but effects of theſe and other his attributes and titles:<note place="margin">Gods workes are his name.</note> as Election, Creation, Preſeruation, Redemption, Iuſtification, Sanctification, Saluation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Occecation Induration, Damnation, Creatures, Ordinances, bleſſings, Iudgements: all which enlightened by the word, doe wonderfully declare what may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of God. Thus we ſee what is the name of God. Further we are to inquire what it is to hallow or ſanctifie Gods name.<note place="margin">What it is to hallow Gods name.</note> For further cleering whereof we muſt know, that Gods name is not prophane or vnholie, though here we pray it may be ſanctified, and hallowed; for all the wicked men and Angels in the world are not able any whit to blemiſh the name of God in it ſelfe, for God and his name are out of their gunſhot: but becauſe men doe merueilouſly prophane &amp; diſhonor the holy and reuerend name of God in themſelues, and before others; it is hence that wee pray that Gods name may be vſed of vs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with all holy reuerence and honorable eſtimation, as beſeemeth the name of ſo great a Maieſtie as is the Lord. A pearle or pretious ſtone, caſt into the ditch or myre, is ſtill pretious; but being ſet in golde or goodly veſtiments, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very beautifully: ſo though wicked men caſt dirt and myre vpon the glorious and pretious name of God, by blaſpheming, and curſing, &amp;c. yet Gods name is ſtill moſt excellent, though it doth not ſo appeare to vs: but when Gods children with religious reuerence handle Gods name, as in preaching, and praying, and depoſing, being lawfully called, then Gods glory and maieſtie, gliſtereth brightly to the view of all the beholders. And this is to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18172:39"/> ſanctifie or hallow Gods name. Wherefore as the Sunne is alwaies in it ſelfe, the fountaine of light, and ſhineth moſt cleerely, howſoeuer ſometime we ſee it not ſo, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eclipſed by the interpoſition of the moone, or ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder a darke cloud, or couered from our ſight by the earth: in like manner the name of God alwaies is full of excellencie and glory; howſoeuer the darkenes of ſin, and the foggie miſt of ignorance and error doth obſcure the ſame, and conceale it from our eyes. Summarily therefore, we pray in this petition, that as Gods workes and word are good and holy in themſelues, ſo by thought, word and deede, we cauſe them to appeare to our ſelues and others.</p>
               <p>To ſanctifie Gods name then is, firſt, to thinke,<note place="margin">3 The ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prayer.</note> ſecondly to ſpeake of, thirdly to vſe the workes, and word of God reuerently.

Wherefore though the Gentiles knew God, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they regarded not to acknowledge him as God,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.21.28.</note> they could not glorifie him, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth.

Hence it is that we reade of diuers ſanctified affections in Gods Saints, according to the diuerſitie of the worke exhibited: as in a miracle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,<note place="margin">Act. 3.10. Pſal. 116.13. Pſa. 119.120.

Iob. 33.25. Pſal. 119.97. Heb. 4.2.</note> ſo our affections muſt moue. In like manner we muſt bee ſtirred with Gods word, as to feare at the threatnings of the law: to reioyce and be comforted with the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpell, generally to beleeue, and to loue euery part of Gods word: thus if our hearts and affections bow and bend at the workes and word of God, we ſanctifie the Lord in our hearts, as the Apoſtle willeth vs. For it ſhall be needleſſe to ſhew how vpon occaſion of meditation in the attributes &amp; titles of God, our affections are to moue: for euery religious heart can ſufficiently inſtruct it ſelfe therein. And thus God is ſanctified within vs.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18172:40"/>
               <p>Now in the next place we muſt conſider how the name of God muſt bee ſanctified before others, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof are our ſpeeches and actions.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place therefore we are by our ſpeeches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to hallow Gods name:<note place="margin">

The obiect whereupon the action is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied is a godly man, the hearer of the word: all which make the action ſo farre forth good: but the agent, and the manner of performing the action may turne it to ſin: for if the agent, that is, the Miniſter or Preacher be a man out of Chriſt, wanting faith and grace, being no member of Chriſt, nor ſubiect of his Kingdome, he cannot poſſibly obey his wil, but the fountaine being vncleane, the ſtreame flowing from the fountaine is vncleane alſo.

For better vnderſtanding of this point, what the Kingdome of God is, conſider ſhortly theſe twelue points which followe.</p>
               <p>Who is the King? Chriſt Ieſus as he is God and man; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> where we muſt know that the Father, and the holy Ghoſt are not excluded: but all the creatures, of what excellencie ſoeuer. Heb. 2.5.</p>
               <p>Who are the ſubiects? They are of two ſorts: true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who are the whole companie of beleeuers whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and counterfeit ſubiects, who though they be in the Church, yet are not of the Church; which diſtinction is grounded, 1. Iohn. 2.</p>
               <p>What are the lawes? They are the law of nature, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is the decalogue: and the lawe of grace, the ſumme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is contained in the Goſpell, namely, faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and obedience, which is the ſumme of the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:18172:50"/>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Who are the enemies? They are theſe ten following. Firſt, Sathan: ſecondly, ſinne: thirdly, death: fourthly, hell or the graue: fifthly, damnation: ſixtly, the world: ſeauenthly, the fleſh: eightly, the Pope and all Papiſts, and heretikes: ninthly, the Turke and all Pagans: tenthly, the hypocrits, Atheiſts, and all prophane and profeſſed wicked men.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> What rewards to the ſubiects? They are in this life, all good things that may profit them, and freedome from all euill which may hurt; and in the life to come, euerlaſting happines in heauen.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> What puniſhments or chaſtiſements? The puniſhments are all taken away in Chriſt, who hath vndergone them for vs: yet there remaine corrections of diuers ſorts to nurture and diſcipline vs, and to keepe vs in awe and ſo forth.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> What weapons to reſiſt our enemies? The weapons are ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> namely, faith, hope loue, righteouſnes, the word, prayer.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> What is the time of this kingdome? It laſteth ſo long as the world endureth in that outward polity, and forme of gouernment eſtabliſhed by the word. 1. Corinth. 15. It laſteth for euer, euen ſo long as God is God, in the moſt gracious and glorious regiment thereof in heauen, theſe outward meanes ceaſing.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> What is the place of this Kingdome? There are two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one is this world, where the Church is militant, fighting againſt her enemies: the other is heauen, where the Church is triumphant raigning for euer.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> What are the offices and officers of this Kingdome? The offices and officers, (beſides theſe that were tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie and extraordinarie, as Prophets, Apoſtles, Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts) are theſe following.</p>
               <p>The firſt office is teaching, and that officer is called a Doctor.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is exhorting, and that officer is called a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:18172:50"/>
               <p>The third office is ruling, and that officer is called an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; in the Church of England, he is called a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The fourth office is diſtributing, and that officer is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Deacon.</p>
               <p>The fifth office is ſhewing mercie, which officer is called a widow. Theſe are all ſet downe. Rom. 12.7.8.</p>
               <p>The queſtions that are betweene the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerning theſe offices and officers, I of purpoſe ſpare to handle, being both vnfit to debate them, and loth to offend; onely I wiſh that ſuch controuerſies might be ended by Councels, and that the peace of the Church might be kept.</p>
               <p>Who is the Deputie or Vicar of this King? There is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> one perſon Chriſts Lieutenant: for wee renounce the Pope, who is Antichriſt; but we acknowledge euery King in his Kingdome, the ſupreme Gouernor in all cauſes, and ouer all perſons, aſwell eccleſiaſticall, as ciuill, next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vnder Chriſt: which Prince hath authoritie to ſubſtitute eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrates according to the word, for the polity of the Church, in the exerciſing of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, viſitation of Churches, and ordination of Miniſters; which perſons in England are called Biſhops.</p>
               <p>What are the properties or qualities of this Kingdome? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> It is ſpirituall, not worldly, and exerciſed vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: wherein it differeth from the ciuill ſtate.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what Gods kingdome is:<note place="margin">How Gods Kingdome commeth.</note> now we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enquire how Gods Kingdome is ſaid to come, namely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it is erected or eſtabliſhed where before it was not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is enlarged and increaſed where before it was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is repaired or reſtored from ſome former decayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When it is perfected and accompliſhed fully: of each ſomething.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">How Gods Kingdome is erected.</note> Gods Kingdome is erected and ſet vp generally
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18172:51"/> and ſpecially: generally when it is entertained by publike conſent in a countrie or Kingdome; and that is when the Magiſtrate by law doth eſtabliſh the worſhip of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word: and execution is done accordingly: and when the Miniſters, in their miniſterie teach and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the word and worſhip of God eſtabliſhed. Specially the Kingdome of God is eſtabliſhed or erected, when men by the word of God are conuerted to the faith, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly make profeſſion thereof. Thus Gods Kingdome is ſet vp.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hovv Gods Kingdome is enlarged.</note>Secondly, Gods Kingdome is enlarged; both when there are new ſubiects made, when as before they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that is to ſay, when there are added to the Church, ſuch as ſhall be ſaued, or when they that are ordained to life euerlaſting beleeue: as alſo when the former ſubiects are confirmed and bettered, that is, when ſuch as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, and doe beleeue, grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hovv Gods Kingdome is repaired.</note>Thirdly, Gods Kingdome is repaired from two great ruines and downefals eſpecially: the one of doctrine, the other of manners, and they are both of them vniuerſall, and particular; for there are ſome which depart totally from the whole doctrine of the ſaith of Chriſt, as when a Chriſtian becommeth a Turke, and ſome depart onely from ſome particular doctrines: as they in the kingdome of Antichriſt. Againe, there are ſome which being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and profeſſing Chriſt, powre out themſelues afterward to all manner of licentious wickednes: others fall into ſome particular ſinnes, as adultery with <hi>Dauid.</hi> Now if a man recouer againe from falſe doctrine, as from Turciſme, or Papiſme, that repayre is dogmaticall: but if a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer by repentance from lapſe into ſinne, that repaire may be called morall: all which kindes both of Apoſtacie, and backſliding, and of repairing and reſtauration, may ſometime befall a whole kingdome or common-wealth, aſwell as particular families or perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hovv Gods</note>Laſtly, Gods Kingdome is perfected and fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18172:51"/> at two times:<note place="margin">Kingdome is perfected.</note> The firſt time is the day of a mans death: the ſecond time is the laſt and general day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The day of death is the ſpeciall perfection of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the ſubiect that dieth, for then grace is perfected and conſummated.</p>
               <p>The day of iudgement is the generall perfection of this kingdome in all the ſubiects thereof, which ſhall either die, or be changed ſuruiuing at that day. The ſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this kingdome, is the glorie of the ſoule only in ſanctification and ſaluation: the generall perfection of this kingdom, is the glorie both of bodie and ſoule, of the whole man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which then ſhall perfectly, according to the meaſure, be ſanctified and glorified. Thus we ſee how the kingdome of God commeth.</p>

For there are certaine bounds and limits wherein conſiſteth a ſufficient qualification to the office of the Miniſterie, whereto if any man be found defectiue, although he may be profitable to the furthering of Chriſts Kingdome in another calling, yet therein he doth harme, in that he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth another, that might doe good: theſe men may be called manglers and hackers of Gods word, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deuide the word aright, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they apt to teach. A skilfull carpenter can by line
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18172:56"/> and leuell ſquare his timber, but a man not brought vp to the trade, will hacke and mangle and mare the timber: ſo the Apoſtles compareth Miniſters to skilfull builders, and not to them that cleane and chop wood, rending and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in peeces, they care not how ſo it be done. For a Miniſter muſt be a maſter of his profeſſion and myſterie, as well; yea much more than other men. Againe, it is one thing to be learned, and another thing to be apt to teach, the one is contemplatiue, the other practicall; for a man may haue knowledge how and what to teach: and yet want gifts of ſpeech to vtter ſignificantly, and profitably, as experience teacheth. By reaſon whereof it falleth out that ſome men hauing good learning, do not edifie others: or hauing ſpeech and wanting learning, are no better than ſounding braſſe, and a tinckling cymball.</p>

Wherefore the Apoſtle requireth that Miniſters ſhould be both apt to teach,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.

And theſe Miniſters greatly hinder the Kingdome of Chriſt, for howſoeuer they preach and may be meanes of conuerſion and edification to thoſe that are conuerted: yet ſurely their euill life doth ſcandalize and offend many, not onely that are without, but ſome weake ones alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of the Church.

               <p>For the firſt we are to know that Gods will is partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to the Church in his word and workes,<note place="margin">VVhat is Gods will.</note> partly kept ſecret to himſelfe in the cloſet of his owne eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; which diſtinction is grounded vpon that ſpeech of <hi>Moſes: The ſecret things to the Lord,</hi>

And thus God doth daily reueale new matters to vs, which before were hidden: thus by the obſeruation and

               <p>But here in oppoſition to this laſt propertie of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels obedience it may bee obiected, that ſeeing it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould perfectly obey Gods will, therefore we muſt not in our prayers aske that at Gods hand: for ſhall it be thought lawfull and reaſonable to aske impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

               <p>Secondly, perfection of number, when obedience is not performed to ſome onely, but to all the commandements of God,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.6.</note> as <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to haue walked in all the commandements and ordinances of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproofe: and this may bee called <hi>perfectio partium ac numero,</hi> when obedience is complete in all the members thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereto one kinde of imperfection is oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, perfection of degree, when obedience in the higheſt and exacteſt meaſure is exhibited: ſo Chriſt onely, and <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocencie, and the holy Angels and Saints in heauen doe obey Gods will: of this Chriſt ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> alleaging the ſentence of the Law: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy ſtrength,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Vngodlines, irreligion, or prophanenes, when men regarde not Gods worſhip, but liue as if there were no God, no heauen, no diuell, no hell, no conſcience: of ſuch
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18172:63"/> Atheiſts the world hath millions, who make no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gods Sabbaths, than of the market or faire, no more reckoning of a ſermon than of a fable of <hi>Eſop,</hi> that for gaining a peny ſweare and forſweare, and what not? thoſe impious wretches are more fearefull and damnable ſinners than the world eſteemeth them, ſeeing they by their practiſe declare themſelues directly to forget God, who is then eſpecially remembred,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> when hee is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

Rebellion, when men peremptorily reſiſt Gods will knowne particularly, and euidently vrged vpon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; or performe not obedience to a ſpeciall precept. Example hereof wee haue in <hi>Saul,</hi> who was commaunded by God vtterly to deſtroy the Amalekites, and all their goods: now he ſaued <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and the fatteſt of the ſheepe and oxen, and ſo flatly rebelled againſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: the puniſhment of this ſinne was moſt fearefull vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which argueth the fearefulnes of the ſinne. And the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1.

The thankſgiuing, which is the laſt thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this petition, may eaſily be collected out of the ſupplication and deprecation: for we bleſſe God that he hath beſtowed vpon vs and others his ſeruants theſe graces following.</p>

               <p>And againe, we praiſe God for that he hath preuented and mortified in vs and other his children the contrarie ſinnes: as firſt, obſtinacie, or impenitencie, and infidelitie: ſecondly, diſobedience to the law in vngodlines, vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, rebellion and vnfaithfulnes: thirdly, ſelfe-will: fourthly, backwardnes: fifthly, hypocriſie.

               <p>Now follow the prayers which directly concerne our ſelues, both in regarde of matters temporal for the body, and alſo of matters ſpirituall for the ſoule: from which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vſed by our Sauiour Chriſt, there is offered vnto vs this inſtruction; that our good dependeth vpon, and iſſueth from Gods glory, and is a neceſſarie conſequent thereof; or thus: when men are carefull to glorifie Gods name, to aduance his Kingdome, and to obey his will, then our daily bread, and all other good followeth thereupon: and contrarily, when men diſhonor God, hinder his Kingdom, and tranſgreſſe his commaundements, thence iſſueth all woe and miſerie.

For howſoeuer to Gods children, hauing grace in ſome ſmall meaſure, and aſſurance of pardon of their ſin, the want of outward matters ſeemeth the greateſt trouble, and therein they bewray their greateſt infirmitie: yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede and in truth the pardon of ſinne, and the aſſurance thereof when the conſcience is poſſeſſed with the feeling of ſinne and Gods wrath, is the greateſt matter, and at that time the trouble for daily bread is nothing, or not ſenſible in compariſon of the feare and doubt of the forgiuenes of ſinne.</p>
               <p>This three-fold reaſon of the order of this petition for daily bread before the petition for grace, affoordeth one doctrine, which may be diſtinguiſhed into three branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our greateſt care muſt be for ſpirituall matters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt learne to depend vpon God for our daily bread, and temporall matters.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, the temporall bleſſings which God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth his children, ought of them to be vſed as arguments and meanes of the aſſurance of remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>

For the ſoule being the principall part of the man, thoſe things which appertaine to the ſoule muſt be principall alſo, and ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally regarded: now in the Scriptures wee ſee oft times the ſoule onely named,<note place="margin">1.

Hence it is that Chriſt and <hi>Steuen</hi> being readie to die,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.46. Act. 7.59.</note> bequethed their ſoules onely into Gods hands: for they knew right well that hee that receiued the ſoule, would not reiect the bodie appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſoule.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The body muſt be prouided for.</note>In the ſecond place, howſoeuer wee are chiefly to ſeeke the ſoules good, yet wee are not to caſt off all care for the bodie; becauſe God in giuing vs a bodie giueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall a ſignification that it ought to bee prouided for: and in that God hath created fruites, and herbes, and fleſh, and other parts of our daily bread, hee inſinuateth the vſe of them, and a care to be had for them: and ſeeing he hath inſpired into men diuers artes manuarie of preparing and fitting our daily bread for our vſe,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.23.25.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18172:66"/> the Lord doth giue vs to vnderſtand that ſometime, and therefore ſome care may bee beſtowed to that end. Here two extremities occurre: careleſnes, and that in the defect; and carefulnes in the exceſſe: The one, that is, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtruſtfull care, diſtracting the minde from the chiefe care equallizeth vs with the Heathen,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.32.30.</note> and argueth little faith: the other, <hi>viz.</hi> no care, no prouiſion, no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and prouidence for our daily bread maketh vs worſe than Infidels,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.8.</note> and is a plaine argument that we haue denied the faith, which eſtabliſheth the meanes of life: for God will haue vs liue ordinarily by bread:<note place="margin">Pro. 6.6.</note> and the Piſmire ſhal teach the ſluggard labour and prouidence, as the Wiſeman morallizeth: wherefore as a moderate care argueth faith in Gods prouidence; ſo an immoderate care, or no care, denieth faith, and maketh men brutiſh or heathniſh.</p>
               <p>In the third place:<note place="margin">Temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings muſt be pledges of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace.</note> As wee are to ſeeke the good of the body aſwell, though not as much, as the good of the ſoule; ſo the good things we obtaine of God for the bodie, ought of vs to bee applied as arguments of confirming our faith, for the obtaining the beſt things for the ſoule, and we muſt make them ſo many pledges and ſeales of Gods loue and mercie to vs in Chriſt Ieſus: for otherwiſe wee partake in Gods bleſſings, which reſpect our daily bread no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the bruite beaſts or the wicked, who haue many good things from Gods generall bountie and liberalitie, but not from his ſpeciall goodnes and mercie. Wee reade that the land of Canaan was by faith inherited of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that by faith they paſſed through the red ſea,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.30.31.</note> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other temporall bleſſings were through faith receiued by them: which is thus to be vnderſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> by faith they receiued theſe temporall deliuerances and bleſſings, and vſed them as ſeales and pledges of heauen and heauenly bleſſings, whereof the former were types onely. And this is to riſe from earth to heauen; from the daily bread of the bodie, to the ſpirituall bread of life; to ſupport and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop our faith in Chriſt for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and the ſaluation of our ſoules, with the earthlie pillars of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18172:67"/> meate, and drinke, and apparell, and what other things are the ſtaffe and ſtay of our bodily life. This doctrine the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhape of the Sacrament ſeemeth to teach vs: for there is bread and wine, the nouriſhers and comforters of our life: whereby the Lord doth ſeale vp vnto vs the ſpirituall nouriſhment and comfort of our ſoules, heauenly matters in earthly creatures. In like manner by analogie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, though not ſacramentally, yet by diſcourſe of reaſon and by a worke of faith wee may allegorize all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward matters. As for example; God giueth vs clothes for to couer our nakednes, therefore hee will giue vnto vs the wedding garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to couer our ſinnes: God giueth the light of the Sunne for our comfort, therefore he will giue vs the light of his countenance in mercie to lighten our darknes and affliction. And thus we may aſcend from things viſible, ſenſible, and palpable, to things inuiſible, inſenſible, and intelligible: and with the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.1.</note> that wee ſee, feele, taſte, and handle the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: yea and grope him in theſe outward matters,<note place="margin">Act. 17.27.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith the Gentiles might haue done God. And this may bee ſufficient for the three particular bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that doctrine which riſeth from the order here vſed by our Sauiour Chriſt, in preferring the petition for daily bread to the petition for grace.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18172:70"/> place laboreth to ſuppreſſe diſtruſtfull,<note place="margin">Merimne.</note> and diſtracting care which deuideth the minde from God and Gods ſeruice: but Chriſt forbiddeth not prouidence, or foreſight, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for the time to come,<note place="margin">Pronoia.</note> which the Apoſtle doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly require in the gouernor of a family:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.8.</note> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe concerning this laying vp in ſtore and moderate prouident care, ſome cautions muſt bee remembred: as firſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.28.</note> that our goods which we treaſure vp, be gotten with our honeſt labor, or that we come by them by inheritance or gift, or by ſome ſuch lawfull meanes; not by gaming or coſoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 62.10.</note>Secondly, that if our riches increaſe we truſt not in them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that wee doe not treaſure them vp when wee ſhould ſpend them in the needfull vſes of the Church or common-wealth: for ſuch times are vnfit times for ſtoring vp. And in this reſpect the Apoſtle commendeth the Church of the Macedonians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.1.2.3.</note> for that they were liberall in their extreame pouertie, the neceſſitie of other Churches requiring it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when we haue treaſured vp riches, we muſt not keepe them niggardly, but we muſt beſtow to the good of our ſelues and others, ſuch a portion of our treaſure as ſhall be requiſit, and befitting our eſtate, wherein ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time we are to paſſe the bounds of our abilitie; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt alſo commendeth the widowes almes of two mites.<note place="margin">Mark. 12.44.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is apparant then, theſe cautions obſerued, that ſtoring vp, and prouident care is not vnlawfull, but very meete: which ſerueth to ouerthrow that ouerlaſhing and ſwagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſpoſition of riotous vnthrifts, which like vnto the prodigall ſonne conſume all their ſubſtance, ſo as at length they are brought to a morſell of bread, and charge others with themſelues and theirs; whereas their patrimonie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderately ordered according to their eſtate, might haue not onely been preſerued entire with the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and reliefe of many poore, but alſo out of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and vſe thereof much might haue been treaſured vp,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18172:70"/> for their poſteritie. For a concluſion therefore of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, couetouſnes is a ſinne, and ſo is prodigalitie: liberalitie and magnificence are vertues, ſo are alſo parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and frugalitie, which by this conſideration are inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The fourth circumſtance followeth, which is <hi>qualitas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat vſe the bread hath. O epi teouſia armozon.</note> the condition or vſe of the bread. The greeke word expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this circumſtance is tranſlated <hi>(daily) epiouſion:</hi> which the Etymologiſt expoundeth, <hi>befitting our ſubstance or being:</hi> namely, ſuch a bread as is meete and conuenient for the preſeruation of our being: and the bread we aske hath this epithite adioyned in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>One is: for that our eſſence and being is in a continuall flux, and, as I may ſo ſay, a naturall conſumption: for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, which is inflicted vpon vs by God,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.17.</note> draweth vs euery day to corruption, and we doe as naturally incline thereto, as the fire goeth vpward: wherefore the Lord in his mercie hath prouided bread, which ſhall ſtay this declining of our nature in part, and repaire the ruine of our eſſence; that as the naturall lampe of our life, conſiſting of fire and oyle,<note place="margin">Calor natiuus. Humidum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicale. <hi>Pſal. 81.16.</hi>
                  </note> ſpendeth and waſteth; ſo there may be a new ſupply made by the fat of wheate, as the Prophet ſpeaketh; till at the length the light of our life be extinct or ſuffocated, either by old age, when the wicke is ſpent, or by diſeaſe and ſudden death, when the heate is choked, or wanteth oyle.</p>
               <p>Another reſpect why the bread is ſo intitled, is, for that this bread can neuer bee added to our ſubſtance for the repaire thereof, except the Lord giue a bleſſing thereto: for as the Prophet ſaith, we may eate and not haue enough,<note place="margin">Leuit. 26. Hag. 1.6.</note> drinke and not bee ſatisfied, vſe marriage, and want chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, earne wages and put it into a bottomles bagge: for howſoeuer the faculties of nouriſhment doth naturally worke in the ſtomacke and other parts, and howſoeuer the bread hath in it a foyſon or iuice fit for nouriſhment, yet the Lord he can ſuſpend the one and the other, ſo as they ſhall neither of them performe their offices: for he can ſtay the worke of all the ſecondarie cauſes: and hee can worke
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18172:71"/> without the helpe of any ſecundarie cauſe. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are taught, both to vſe the bread, it being the meanes God hath appointed for our preſeruation: and alſo not to truſt in the bread, ſeeing that it cannot helpe vs if God ſuſpend the vertue thereof: more plainely, two ſinnes are here diſcouered, and ſecretly reproued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, tempting of God, which is drawing too neere God.</p>
               <p>Second is a ſecret idolatry, withdrawing our ſelues from God.</p>
               <p>All they tempt God which neglecting the bread, which is the ordinary helpe of our life, doe caſt themſelues vpon the immediate prouidence of God: as the diuell perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our Sauiour Chriſt to caſt himſelfe downe headlong from the pinacle of the temple,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.6.</note> when hee might come downe the ſtaires: for God will not haue vs neglect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the meanes which he hath giuen vs.</p>
               <p>All they withdraw themſelues from God which make idols of the bread, which vſe the bread, and neuer aske a bleſſing at Gods hands vpon the bread, as if God were tied to giue his bleſſing to the bread neceſſarily: this is the ſinne which is oft times reproued by the Prophets: for example, to truſt in chariots and horſes: to truſt in Princes, to truſt in the Phyſition, generally to truſt in an arme of fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VVhoſe the bread is.</note>The fifth and laſt circumſtance followeth, which is <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> whoſe the bread is, or the owner of it. Chriſt calleth it our bread, and that in diuers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For that it is ſo indeede wee hauing gotten it by our labour and induſtry, or hauing it by inheritance or gift of friends: and according to this conſtruction the Apoſtle willeth the Theſſalonians to eate their owne bread which they haue earned with the labours of their hands:<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.12.</note> this is the ciuill title which is called <hi>ius adrem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For that it is the childrens bread, according as Chriſt ſaith to the Canaanitiſh woman:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.26.</note> which was through <hi>Adams</hi> fall loſt, but now through Chriſts redemption is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18172:71"/> reſtored to vs againe, as appeareth plainely by the Prophet in the Pſalme. And this is called <hi>ius in re,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> the religious title.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For that we deſire no more of the bread than is fit for vs, as <hi>Agur</hi> prayeth in his propheſie:<note place="margin">Prou. 30.</note> and the Lord ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doth beſtow vpon vs onely, and all that part of the bread which is good for vs:<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.10. Rom. 8.28.</note> for we ſee that diuers of Gods children haue ſeuerall and different portions of this bread: <hi>Abraham</hi> hee had abundance: <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſcanted; yet each of them had his bread, euen a portion conuenient for him. So that this laſt circumſtance inſinuateth vnto vs three vertues.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Induſtrie, which is in ſome honeſt calling to get our liuing with the ſweate of our browes: and not to walke inordinately, yea though thou haue great liuing and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of thine owne. For although it may ſeeme needles for him to labour which is wealthie, yet indeede there is an ineuitable neceſſitie thereof. For beſides that God hath impoſed this yoke vpon all in <hi>Adam</hi> to eate the labours of their hands, and the ſweate of their browes,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.19. Pſal. 128.2.</note> and ſo they which doe not labour walke inordinatly,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.10.7.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> as a ſouldier out of his ranke; the Apoſtle alſo ſaith that he which doth not labour, ſhould not eate:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.28.</note> and one end of laboring in a calling is, that we may haue the more to beſtow vpon them that want: therefore euen the King himſelfe, the Iudge, and the Counſellor, and the Miniſter is to ſweate for his liuing, though he dig not with the ſpade: which is when the mind laboreth and trauelleth in thought, and counſell, and care, and prouidence, and inſtruction, dropping as it were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible ſweate from the browes of the vnderſtanding, and the inward parts of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thankfulnes to the Lord, that he hath reſtored to vs that intereſt which was loſt through <hi>Adams</hi> fall: that we may freely and with good conſcience vſe any part of the bread which is our owne; not onely for our neceſſitie, but euen for our moderate delight and comfort, ſeeing that God hath giuen wine to comfort the heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.15.</note> and oyle to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18172:72"/> make the face ſhine,<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.5.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> had his head annoynted with oyle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Contentment in our eſtate whatſoeuer, ſeeing that is the beſt eſtate, and that part of the bread is moſt fit and meete for vs: for howſoeuer perhaps we doe not ſo thinke, yet ſurely if wee finde in our ſelues the markes of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and if we labour to obſerue the worke of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs at that time, wee ſhall be compelled to ſay from our owne experience, that then God in wiſedome ſaw ſuch a portion was beſt for vs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.71.</note>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Quid,</hi> what we aske (forgiue)</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Cuius,</hi> whereof we aske forgiuenes (debts.)</p>

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Quorum,</hi> of whoſe debts we aske forgiuenes: (ours)</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat we ask? forgiuenes.</note>The firſt point is, what wee aske: that is, pardon or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes. Debts or ſinnes are diſcharged two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the debtor himſelfe doth ſatisfie in his owne perſon: thus the damned men and Angels diſcharge their debt to God, who for that they are neuer able to pay the vtmoſt farthing, are therefore kept in priſon, and damned euerlaſtingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When another perſon doth ſatisfie for the debtor, and the debt is forgiuen the debtor by him that ſatisfieth. Thus the debts of Gods children are diſcharged through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, who hath paied the vtmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the creditor, to God his Father for vs. This may be called remiſſion or forgiuenes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note>1. In reſpect of vs that receiue it, we conferring no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereto, nor any way purchaſing it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This point then hath this vſe: It teacheth vs to caſt down all pride in our hearts, and to emptie our ſelues of all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our owne merits and excellencie, and to come with ropes about our heads before the King of Iſrael.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. King. 20.31.</hi> VVhereof we aske pardon? of our debts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond point followeth: whereof we deſire forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: namely, of our debts, that is, of our ſinnes: for ſinne containeth in it a threefold debt: firſt, tranſgreſſion, or diſobedience, which is the priuation of obedience, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof wee ſtill are indebted obedience to God: for they that doe obey Gods law, notwithſtanding ſtill are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted obedience, and therefore much more they which diſobey Gods law are indebted obedience through their diſobedience.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh according to this ſenſe concerning the ſumme of the ſecond table, calling loue a debt which wee alwaies owe vnto our neighbour; and ſo by conſequence vnto God: wherefore the neglect of loue is much more a debt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſinne containeth in it the puniſhment, which, by reaſon of our tranſgreſſion, wee are indebted to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe: and according to this our Sauiour Chriſt calleth ſinne a debt, ſaying,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.26.</note> that they whom the Sergeant at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Iudge caſt into priſon, ſhall not come thence till they haue paied the vtmoſt farthing, that is, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained the due puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſin is a debt in regard of the corruption which accompanieth the tranſgreſſion:<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.6.</note> for God requireth of vs puritie and ſanctimonie, which we are indebted vnto God alwaies; but much more are wee indebted holines when our hearts are full of impietie, and diſhoneſtie. Briefly then, becauſe all ſinne is a tranſgreſſion of the law, binding the tranſgreſſor in guiltines to ſuffer puniſhment, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the tranſgreſſor with vncleannes: thence it followeth that the ſinner is ſo greatly indebted to God.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18172:75"/>
               <p>The vſe of this poynt is to ſtirre vs vp diligently to ſeeke pardon of our debts, which doe ſo greatly indanger vs to Gods iuſtice and wrath: and whereby we are triple deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vnto the Lord, but we are for the moſt part like vnto prodigall dingthrifts, we neuer regard how much we goe vpon the ſcore, we neuer thinke that the day of reckening or payment will come:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.25.</note> it were good for vs (according as Chriſt aduiſeth vs:) to agree with our aduerſary quickly, euen while we are in the way with him: it is the Lord with whom we muſt agree,<note place="margin">Antidicos.</note> who is a fearefull aduerſarie, that will proſecute law againſt vs before a iudge that will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept no mans perſon, that hath thine owne conſcience as good as a thouſand witneſſes to proue the debt: yea, it is wiſedome to agree quickelie being in the way with him, whileſt he doth reaſon and diſpute the matter friendly in the Miniſterie of the word, leaſt if death and hell, the Lords ſergeant once lay hold vpon vs, and arreſt vs, we be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perpetuall impriſonment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">For whom we aske pardon? for our ſelues and others. Pardon for our ſelues.</note>The third poynt followeth, for whom we aske forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, namely for our ſelues and others, our friends and our enemies.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For our ſelues, yea though we know we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and haue already obtained pardon at Gods hands for our ſinnes: for Chriſt teacheth his diſciples to make this prayer, who no doubt had their ſinnes pardoned before: but it may be obiected, that it is needles to aske that which a man hath alreadie, and will it not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mockerie to deale thus with God? This knot is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two waies: (firſt) ſome anſwere that Chriſt teacheth vs to aske forgiuenes, not as it commeth from God, which is graunted already to Gods children, but as it commeth to vs, and as we apprehend and applie the merit of Chriſt for forgiuenes: as if this ſhould be the meaning; Lord giue me grace more effectually to apply to my ſoule by faith, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for the pardon of my ſinne: others, and that more fully, anſwer (ſecondly) thus; that it is in the worke of iuſtification or remiſſion of ſinne, as in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18172:75"/> the worke of creation: for as when God had created <hi>Adam,</hi> he was continually preſent with him by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſupport his being,<note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> and to ſtay and preſerue his ſubſtance and nature, which prouidence is nothing elſe but as it were a continuall creation; euen ſo when God hath iuſtified a ſinner, and forgiuen him his ſinnes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually is aſſiſtant to the partie iuſtified, vpholding his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: this cannot be termed properlie a ſecond iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but a continuall ſupporting of iuſtification, no more than preſeruation can be termed a ſecond creation. Now further this continuall ſupporting of iuſtification is performed by the application of the ſalue to the ſore,<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.5.</note> of Chriſts righteouſnes to the wounded ſoule of the ſinner: which application is the worke of Gods holy ſpirit princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and not of faith onely inſtrumentally. For further declaration of this poynt we are to know, that when God iuſtifieth a ſinner, he giueth him whole Chriſt and all his merits for euer, ſo that the partie iuſtified cannot poſſiblie leeſe Chriſt: yet the Lord doth onely applie Chriſt and his merits, as it were the ſalue, to thoſe ſinnes and ſores that are alreadie in his ſoule burſt out, for the which he ſeeketh the ſalue, and for which he asketh pardon and is humbled: afterward as new ſinnes and ſores grow, and hee eſpieth them, feeleth them, and asketh the ſalue for them, the Lord applieth Chriſt the ſalue vnto them. Wherefore directly and fully to anſwere the obiection, Gods children aske at Gods hands that which they haue not: for although in the counſell of God, in the redemption of Chriſt, in the donation of Chriſt to the partie iuſtified by the Father, at the very firſt moment of iuſtification it may truly bee ſaid, that all his ſinnes are forgiuen, paſt, preſent, and to come: yet in regard of the particular application of Chriſts ſtripes to the ſores of ſinne in the ſoule, it cannot be ſaid that the godly mans ſinnes are pardoned, or forgiuen, or cured, or couered, till they be committed, till they be eſpied, till the pardon thereof be asked. Gods children therefore doe not aske a primarie iuſtification, but a ſecondarie application:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18172:76"/> they doe not deſire to be made righteous of perſons whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnrighteous, but to bee made righteous from ſome particular vnrighteouſneſſe: As a man that is, deſireth God ſtill to preſerue his being by daily bread; ſo a man that is iuſtified, deſireth God ſtill to ſupport his iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a continuall application of the ſalue to the ſore. Wherefore to conclude, Gods actions in iuſtification are two: firſt, the donation and gift of Chriſt: ſecondly, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt giuen. As a Chirurgion giueth a boxe of ſalue to a wounded perſon, and after applieth plaiſters of the ſalue to the wounds as they breake out in the bodie. And ſometime the Lord doth deferre and ſuſpend the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the plaiſter of Chriſts blood to the ſores of ſin in the ſoule, that he may prouoke vs the more earneſtly to conſider of the hainouſnes of ſinne, more ſeriouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile ſinne, more carefully to auoide future ſinnes, ſeeing the ſmart of former ſinnes is ſo ſharpe, more feruently and with greater perſeuerance to pray vnto God for pardon thereof, and with greater ioy and thankfulnes to receiue the pardon of ſinne from our gratious God.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine then in briefe is thus much: to teach vs daily to obſerue our ſinnes and particular lapſes, and accordingly to deſcend to a particular confeſſion and penitencie for them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> and particularly to deſire forgiuenes with the application of Chriſts righteouſnes, according as we doe euery day deſire bread for our nouriſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Pardon for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>2 Thus we pray forgiuenes for our ſelues: we pray alſo pardon and forgiuenes for others, yea euen for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, according to the example of Chriſt, <hi>Stephen,</hi> &amp;c. but this point hath alreadie been handled in the preface of the Prayer, to which place the reader is to bee referred: onely thus much wee are here to learne, pitie and compaſſion to them that pitie not themſelues, that ſeeing it is vnknowne vnto vs how the Lord will deale with men that liue in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie and groſſe ſinnes, wee are therefore to hope the beſt in charitie, and ſeeing they are of our owne fleſh to haue commiſeration of them, it may bee that the Lord will
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18172:76"/> at the inſtance of a godly mans prayer,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note> which auaileth much, haue mercie vpon them; as it is ſuppoſed hee had mercie vpon <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer, and the Centurion at Chriſts.</p>
               <p>The fourth point followeth, which is,<note place="margin">For whoſe ſins vve aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? ours.</note> whoſe debts and ſinnes they are whereof wee aske pardon. They are called ours in a double reſpect: firſt, for that they are ours proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee hauing committed them againſt the Maieſtie of God, and for that we cannot lay our ſinnes vpon God, the diuell, or other men: for God hee doth not compell vs to commit ſinne, neither doth hee inſpire wickednes into vs,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.13.</note> ſeeing he tempteth no man to ſinne: and howſoeuer the diuell or wicked men may tempt vs, yet wee willingly and freely yeeld to the temptation, and take a delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the committing of ſinne: and though a wicked man be a ſeruant and ſlaue to ſinne and Satan, yet hee is ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and he ſelleth himſelfe for a ſlaue, as it is ſaid of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Sinne is called ours emphatically,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18. Gal. 6.4.5.</note> to ſignifie thus much, that ſeeing the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die, and that euery one ſhall beare his owne burthen, therefore we eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeke for the pardon of our owne ſinnes, howſoeuer wee are not to neglect our dutifull and charitable prayers for other men.</p>
               <p>The laſt point is,<note place="margin">For whoſe ſake we aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? Chriſts.</note> through whoſe merits we aske forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: which is implied in the word <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>forgiuenes:</hi> for which purpoſe we muſt know that God is a iuſt God, and therefore he will be ſatisfied wherein his iuſtice is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and God can no more forgiue ſin without any ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction done vnto his iuſtice, than he can ceaſe to be iuſt or ceaſe to be good: wherefore in that Chriſt teacheth vs to aske forgiuenes, there is neceſſarily inſinuated ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to bee made to Gods iuſtice: and therefore ſome perſon to make that ſatisfaction: which perſon is Chriſt Ieſus God-man, in whoſe name wee are to pray, and through whoſe ſatisfaction and obedience we obtaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes: and ſo God continueth iuſt, becauſe hee pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18172:77"/> not before he be ſatisfied, and yet is moſt mercifull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in prouiding a meanes for the diſcharge of our debt, whereas we were <hi>non ſoluendo,</hi> vtter bankerupts, neuer able to pay our debt: and ſo the Prophets ſpeech is fulfilled: <hi>Mercie and truth are met:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 85.10.</note> 
                  <hi>righteouſneſſe and peace kiſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe of which point is to teach vs, that when wee come to aske diſcharge of our debts, we bring our acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with vs, otherwiſe we can neuer be diſcharged. And here there is ſome difference betwixt the paiments of men and Gods paiment: for with men the creditor giueth an acquittance to the debtor; but here the ſinner, who is the debtor to God, giueth an acquittance to the creditor, which notwithſtanding before the creditor freely gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him vpon the diſcharge made by the ſuretie Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: briefly and plainly thus much, when we craue pardon of our ſinnes we muſt bring with vs faith to applie Chriſts righteouſnes; which being applied vnto vs, our debts are diſcharged in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt part of the petition, <hi>viz.</hi> the thing wee aske.<note place="margin">The condition of the petition.</note> The ſecond followeth, the condition whereupon we aske pardon.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>As we forgiue our debtors.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe words are an inſtrument ſeruing to ſeuerall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: wherein wee may conſider both the meaning and vſe of them. For the meaning of the words two points muſt be noted.</p>
               <p n="1">1 How other men are our debtors.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How we forgiue other men their debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hovv other men are our debtors.</note>Firſt, to know how other men are our debtors, wee muſt conſider that ſinne containeth alwaies an offence to God, ſometime alſo an offence to man. The offence which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God is the violating of his holy and righteous law which is the rule of his iuſtice. The offence which is again: man, is the iniurie which is done againſt the perſon, honor life, goods, good name or honeſtie of any man, whereby
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18172:77"/> any of them is diminiſhed or aboliſhed in our neighbour: as in murther, the life of a man is diminiſhed; in theft, his goods; in ſlaunder, his good name; in fornication, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, &amp;c. Now the offence and iniurie of our neighbour containeth the debt which wee owe vnto him: for firſt, in that we haue wronged him, we haue not loued him, and ſo we owe loue vnto him: ſecondly, we owe a ſatisfaction or amends, which in equitie muſt be made to the partie iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: thirdly, we owe vnto him a certaine puniſhment alſo, which in equitie may bee exacted and inflicted vpon the partie offending. And in theſe reſpects other men are our debtors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we forgiue other men their debts,<note place="margin">How we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue other men.</note> when wee remit, not the tranſgreſſion of Gods law, for that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for none can forgiue ſinne but God: but either the wrong, the ſatisfaction, or the puniſhment: ſometime all three, ſometime two, ſometime one onely, namely the wrong or iniurie done vnto vs; which wrong we doe here profeſſe our ſelues readie to forgiue, and thereupon deſire God to forgiue vs.</p>
               <p>But for further declaration of this matter wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when man forgiueth the wrong, God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies forgiue the ſinne: for there bee many perſecutors whoſe ſins are neuer forgiuen of God, and yet Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are perſecuted by them forgiue them the wrong, which through their perſecutions they ſuſtaine: ſo Chriſt and <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed for their perſecutors, ſome of whom (as is probable) God neuer pardoned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though man doe not forgiue the wrong, yet the Lord ſometime may and doth forgiue the ſinne: for if there be any man found ſo cruelly mercileſſe as that he wil not forgiue his enemies, his ſinne is the greater, and his charitie is the leſſe, and hee can haue little or no comfort that God will pardon him: but if the partie that hath done the wrong, doe craue pardon at Gods hands, and ſatisfie or make reſtitution according to equitie to the partie
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18172:78"/> wronged, the Lord forgiueth the ſin and the wrong both to himſelfe and to man: for God can forgiue, and doth forgiue both, vpon performance of the condition of true repentance,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.24.</note> which containeth in it ſatisfaction or reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or amends.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though God forgiue the ſinne, and man alſo forgiue the wrong, yet man may vrge the partie culpable to ſatisfaction and puniſhment according to the law of God, and of the nation where they liue: yea ſometime the partie wronged ought ſo to doe neceſſarily, otherwiſe hee ſhall ſinne againſt God and the Common-wealth. This wee ſee euidently in the theefe vpon the croſſe:<note place="margin">Luk. 23.40.41.</note> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue him his ſinne, and yet he confeſſeth he was iuſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.19.20.</note> and <hi>Achan</hi> was puniſhed according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and yet it is very probable by his confeſſion of his fault that hee repented: and certaine it is that <hi>Ioſua</hi> forgaue the wrong: and if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſpared any murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or adulterer from death, hee had offended God, and damnified the common good, ſeeing that ſuch ſinnes doe defile a nation.</p>
               <p>All which hath this vſe, that though a man doe proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a felon, or a murderer to death, yet hee may forgiue him: and therefore the guiltie perſons want charitie, in reuiling and making outcries againſt the perſecutors of iuſtice, as if they were blood-ſuckers, and ſo foorth: for ſometime the qualitie of the offender is ſuch, as that if hee bee ſuffered to liue, the Common-wealth is in daunger to ſuſtaine much detriment, beſides the great offence done to the righteous law of God, which hath awarded death to ſome ſort of ſinners. Againe, much more therefore is it lawfull for a man to commence ſuite of law, and to be the plaintife in a manifeſt iniurie thereby to recouer his right, and to obtaine ſatisfaction, and that without any breach of charitie: for there is a difference to be made betwixt an Enemy &amp; an Aduerſary: the one is cauſed of hatred to the man:<note place="margin">Echthros. Antidicos.</note> the other of a loue to iuſtice; and a man may retaine loue and be another mans aduerſarie; ſo can hee not and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18172:78"/> be his enemie: wherefore if a man haue a controuerſie with another, and retaine loue and charitie with his neighbour, (as hee may very well) notwithſtanding the ſuite, hee may worthily partake in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, though ſome bogle at it: wherein they bewray either their malice, ignorance or ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the meaning of the condition: now the vſe thereof is three-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is a probation of our charitie and loue to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whereby wee may gather comfort of pardon from God, or be terrified and humbled through deſpaire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is euidently expounded by our Sauiour Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If you forgiue others, God will forgiue you:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.15. &amp;. 18.33.</note> or if you will not forgiue others, neither will God forgiue you.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It ſerueth for a profeſſion of our loue and charitie to others, yea towards our enemies by forgiuing them: for by this ſpeech publikely vttered in the aſſemblie of the people we proclaime to all the hearers our inward diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which certainly doe poſſeſſe the hearts of all thoſe, whoſe ſinnes the Lord hath pardoned.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It ſerueth for an argument enforcing the petition for remiſſion of ſinne: as if this were the fenſe: Lord forgiue vs, for we forgiue others: as if this were the argument:<note place="margin">Luk. 11.4.</note> The mercifull ſhall obtaine mercie.</p>
               <p>But we Lord are mercifull in pardoning others:</p>
               <p>Therefore Lord be mercifull in pardoning vs.</p>
               <p>And for this latter vſe wee are to know, that none of all the petitions haue a ſpeciall argument particularly fixed to the ſide of it but this, as if our Sauiour Chriſt would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto vs thereby the weakenes of our faith in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which moſt concerneth vs, <hi>viz.</hi> the pardon of our ſins, and the meanes whereby we might beſt fortifie our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by forgiuing our enemies.</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond thing conſidered in this petition,<note place="margin">3 The ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Secondly, this doctrine ariſeth from the former,<note place="margin">He that hath grace reſiſteth the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that he which hath grace can in ſome meaſure reſiſt temptation, and if ſo be that ſometime through the violent whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde of a temptation, he take the foyle by the temptor, yet after hee recouereth himſelfe and gathereth more ſtrength and courage to the next encounter, and at the length giueth his enemie the ouerthrow, and triumpheth ouer him; and this power and grace is communicated vnto vs from Chriſt our head, who was therfore tempted, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the temptor,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.

                  <item>2 What is to deliuer from euill, or how God deliuereth from euill.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt therfore to know what euill is, we muſt know what good is, that by the oppoſition of contraries the matter may be more euident. Good is of three ſorts: for there is a naturall good, a morall good, and a good inſtrument: and ſo by contrarietie: there is a naturall euill, a morall euill, and an euill inſtrument.</p>
               <p>A natural good is whatſoeuer God hath at the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: ſo the Lord ſaith that all his works were good:<note place="margin">

               <p>A morall good is whatſoeuer qualitie is in the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabe creature agreeable to the law morall,<note place="margin">

               <p>The good of good is that fruite or commoditie which Gods children reape by all the gifts of God;<note place="margin">The good of good.</note> as the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of health and wealth, peace and libertie, the word and all the meanes of grace, whereby the godly man is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted and refreſhed in his bodie, but furthermore fed and nouriſhed and ſtrengthened in his ſoule to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The euill of good is that hurt and detriment which the wicked reape by all the gifts of God aforeſaid,<note place="margin">The euill of good.</note> as that not onely their life, health, peace, libertie, wealth and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the world, but alſo all the meanes of grace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation becommeth the bane and poyſon both of ſoule and bodie to their euerlaſting damnation another day: that although the wicked are nouriſhed by their meate, and cured by their phyſicke, and inſtructed and reprooued by the word, &amp;c. yet there is a ſecret poyſon therewithall infuſed into their ſoules, which ſhall another day in Gods appointed time burſt out to their vtter ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>The good of euill is that good which the Lord as a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Phyſition gathereth from the afflictions and ſinnes of his children, as it were a purgation out of poiſon:<note place="margin">The good of euill.</note> for God can and doth expell one ſinne with another, and many ſins with afflictions: as a father, correcting, and amending the faults of his children by correction.</p>

               <p n="1">1 That ſeeing temptation and affliction are in their owne nature the meanes and puniſhments of ſinne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no caſe we are to pray for them, but againſt them: for God forbiddeth vs to practiſe any thing that is a means of ſinne, and therefore conſequently he willeth vs to pray againſt all the meanes of ſinne, as temptation is: and ſeeing afflictions in their owne nature and firſt inſtitution are Gods plagues vpon ſinners, we are to auoide them by all meanes poſſible (as we doe) and ſo to pray againſt them.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>Now more ſpecially, faith is ſupported by one argument principally, <hi>[thine is kingdome,]</hi> which may be framed after this forme.</p>
               <p>Euery good king will prouide, not onely for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of his kingdome, for the obedience of his lawes, and for his honour and glorie; but alſo for the good and welfare of his ſubiects, in ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>But thou Lord, art a good King, for the kingdome is thine.</p>
               <p>Thou therefore wilt prouide, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This argument doth either directly or indirectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith for the obtaining of all the ſixe petitions, as may eaſily be perceiued: directly it confirmeth our faith in the ſecond, but indirectly and by conſequent in all the reſt.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:18172:91"/>
               <p>This kingdome of God, which is the ground of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, is amplified by three arguments:
<list>
                     <item>1 It is a powerfull kingdome. <hi>[thine is power.]</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 It is a glorious kingdome. <hi>[thine is glorie.]</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 It is an euerlaſting kingdome. <hi>[for euer.]</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo there are three other arguments whereby our faith is ſupported for obtaining the petitions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument therefore which is taken from the power of God is added neceſſarily as an anſwere to an obiection, which might be oppoſed thus:<note place="margin">Power of Gods kingdome.</note> though God be a king, yet except he haue power to ſubdue his enemies, the aduauncement of his kingdome ſhall be hindered: the anſwere whereof is, that as God is a king, ſo he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, able to conquer all his enemies that ſhall rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: and ſo this argument taken from Gods power may thus be concluded. A king that is of abilitie will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his kingdome, cauſe himſelfe to be honoured, cauſe his ſubiects to obey his will, and prouide for the outward proſperitie and inward felicitie of his ſubiects:</p>
               <p>God he is of abilitie being a powerfull king:</p>
               <p>Therefore he will prouide for his honour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third argument is taken from the glory of Gods kingdome:<note place="margin">Glory of Gods kingdome.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Where firſt, conſider the meaning of the words: <hi>Thine is glorie:</hi> that is, 1. Thou haſt made al things for thy glory. 2. The things we aske are meanes of thy glory. 3. The things we aske ſhall by vs be referred to thy glory: and ſo the concluſion followeth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> graunt vs theſe things which we aske in theſe petitions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs alſo conſider the argument framed thus, directly confirming our faith for the firſt petition.</p>
               <p>That which is moſt deere to thy ſelfe thou wilt procure:</p>
               <p>But thy glory is moſt deere to thy ſelfe:</p>
               <p>Therefore glorifie thy ſelfe by vs or in vs, or giue vs grace to glorifie thy name.</p>
               <p>Indirectly it confirmeth our faith in all the other petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after this manner.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:18172:92"/>
               <p>Thou Lord wilt further all the meanes of thy glorie:</p>
               <p>But the enlarging of thy kingdome, the obedience of thy will, our daily bread, remiſſion of ſinne, and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace are meanes of thy glory:</p>
               <p>Therefore Lord we are perſwaded thou wilt cauſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The eternitie of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>The fourth argument wherby our faith is ſtrengthened, is taken from the eternitie or euerlaſting continuance of this kingdome, and of the two other properties thereof, mentioned in the ſecond and third arguments: for the kingdome, power and glory of God is euerlaſting, or Gods powerfull and glorious kingdome is eternall, and that in a double reſpect:</p>
               <p n="1">1 In themſelues, for that they neuer haue end:</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the faithfull, who doe and will euerlaſtingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and magnifie the Lord, the moſt mighty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious king.</p>
               <p>This fourth argument is framed after this manner:</p>
               <p>If thy kingdome, power, and glory ſhall euerlaſtingly be remembred and magnified by vs, as it is euerlaſting in it ſelfe: then grant theſe our praiers which are means thereof.</p>
               <p>But by granting theſe our petitions, we ſhall be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to procure the euerlaſting remembrance of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power and glory, by our ſelues as long as we liue, by our holy ſeede after vs, and for euermore in thy heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are perſwaded thou wilt graunt vs theſe our petitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Faith is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: God is not perſwaded by arguments.</note>Thus our faith is ſupported and ſtrengthened by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are vſed not to perſwade God, who is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and immoueable in his purpoſes; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, who are of little faith, and ſcarſe beleeue God himſelfe, and therefore haue need to find out in our ſelues ſtrong arguments, as it were maine pillars to ſupport our faith, as it were a craſie houſe ready to fall to decay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Deſire, a part of feruency.</note>The ſecond part of feruencie is deſire, which is expreſſed in the word, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:18172:92"/>
               <p>As faith is the principall worke of the vnderſtanding, ſo deſire is the principall worke of the will in regard of that which we want: and as faith may well be compared to the hand or arme, laying hold vpon bleſſings, ſo deſire may be compared to the brawne or ſinewes of the arme or hand, the inſtruments of ſtrength, whereby wee holde faſt that which we apprehend.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> This is expreſſed by <hi>Matthew</hi> in very ſignificant and forcible metaphors: <hi>Aske,</hi> as a begger doth to get an almes: <hi>Seeke,</hi> as one with a candle looketh for a iewell loſt vpon the ground: <hi>Knocke,</hi> with ſtrength and force to get open the gate of Mercie.

               <p>Thou Lord art a God of trueth,<note place="margin">Amen contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſupport our faith.</note> thou art true in all thy promiſes; thy promiſes are yea and Amen: thou art A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the faithfull and true witneſſe: thou keepeſt fidelitie for euer:</p>

               <p>Therefore grant theſe our petitions ſo qualified.</p>
               <p>Thus the manner of making our prayers is taught vs in the concluſion of this prayer, which is feruencie in the two parts thereof, faith and deſire. Now contrary to feruencie is coldnes in prayer,<note place="margin">Coldnes in prayer.</note> whereof ſomething briefely muſt be ſpoken, that contraries may be more perſpicuous by their oppoſition.

               <p>In briefe therefore to conclude this concluſion: wee muſt ſtriue and wraſtle with the Lord in time of prayer, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did with the Angell,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 32.24. Hoſea. 12.4</note> holding him faſt, not letting him goe till he bleſſe vs, till he change our names, and call vs Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, men preuailing with God: that ſo after our prayers we may find ſpirituall ioy and comfort, and incouragement in all our waies, which is the fruite of feruent prayer.</p>
               <p>Here ſhould bee the end of this treatiſe, but that there are certaine extrauagant queſtions to bee diſcuſſed, which could not be referred to any one proper place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer method, and yet containe matter very profitable, though onely probable and conſiſting of vncertainties and coniectures for the moſt part. The queſtions, with their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, are briefely theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">VVhether Chriſt prayed the Lords prayer.</note>1 Whether Chriſt euer prayed the Lords prayer?</p>
               <p>The anſwere: It is probable that Chriſt did pray the Lords prayer himſelfe, for himſelfe and for vs: for although the expoſitors ſay that the word <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>Naturae nomen, non perſonae:</hi> that is to ſay, common to all the three perſons, not proper to the firſt perſon: and therefore it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if Chriſt prayed this prayer, he ſhould pray to himſelfe: yet if it be ſaid that the word <hi>Father</hi> may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper to the father, or common to all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or both; there will no abſurditie follow, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is anſwered. Againe, if it be obiected further that Chriſt ſhould pray for the pardon of ſinnes, he hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no ſinne, thereby giuing occaſion to thinke that he had ſinne: the anſwere will be very indifferent, that Chriſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18172:93"/> might vſe that petition as an inſtrument of interceſſion for vs, and not as a petition for pardon of his ſinne, preſcribing it neuertheleſſe vnto vs for a prayer of remiſſion who had ſinned: or elſe it might be anſwered, that Chriſt being the ſuretie might intreate God to pardon his ſinnes, not the ſinnes which he had committed, but the ſinnes which were to him imputed: or the petition being deliuered plurally, <hi>(forgiue vs)</hi> it may bee Chriſt prayed for both: and there was no doubt of miſconceit in his Diſciples, to whom hee priuately expounded doubtfull matters: and if the matter bred any miſconceit in the other auditors, it was through their own corruption and ignorance, and therein the Lords iuſtice might appeare in blinding their mindes and harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts, as himſelf teacheth, who oft times ſpake obſcurely and ambiguouſly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How oft Chriſt vſed the Lords prayer? and how?<note place="margin">How oft Chriſt vſed the Lords prayer, and how.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwere of this queſtion is partly certaine, partly probable. It is certaine that Chriſt vſed the Lords prayer twice: firſt, he vſed it when he taught the doctrine of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and ſo <hi>Matthew</hi> hath propounded it as a part of the ſermon in the mount. Secondly, he vſed it when he taught his Diſciples a forme of prayer, according to the example of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who taught his Diſciples a paterne of prayer, and this was preſently after Chriſt had ended his prayers in a certaine place, as <hi>Luke</hi> reporteth: whence in all probabilitie it may be collected, that <hi>Matthew</hi> preſcribeth this prayer one way, and <hi>Luke</hi> another: for in <hi>Matthew</hi> Chriſt taught the doctrine of prayer, and ſo it is dogmaticall in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: Luke</hi> ſaith Chriſt taught a prayer: for his words are, <hi>When ye pray, ſay:</hi> and ſo it is practical: ſo that Chriſt taught it both for a prayer which his Diſciples might vſe, and for the doctrine of prayer, which his Diſciples might teach. Againe, it is probable that Chriſt neuer vſed this prayer but twice, although it cannot be demonſtratiuely proued; onely this coniecture we haue, that whereas Chriſt maketh diuers prayers to his Father in the Euangeliſts, this is not mentioned, nor any petition of it in ſo many words, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18172:94"/> the Euangeliſts neuer name it elſewhere by any ſpeciall name, and the Apoſtles in their writings neuer make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: but when they pray in their writings vſe other formes, though ſtill they keep themſelues within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the matter and affections of this prayer (which we call the Lords prayer, both for that it was compoſed by Chriſt and vſed by him:) hence therefore it followeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bablie, that the Apoſtles neuer tied themſelues to the words of this prayer, but varied vpon occaſion. Briefly then, Chriſt vſed this prayer twice: but it cannot certainly be determined whether he vſed it oftner: neither can it be proued that the Apoſtles vſed it often.</p>

               <p>The anſwere is onely coniecturall: for it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he vſed the very words ſet downe by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: the reaſon is, for that the Euangeliſts vſe to ſet down, not all and onely the words which Chriſt ſpake, but the ſumme and ſubſtance of them: and if it be graunted that the Euangeliſts haue done it in other places, why may they not doe it in this place? eſpecially ſeeing the Euangeliſts doe differ in words in reciting many of Chriſts ſpeeches, as namely of the Beatitudes:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.3.

                  <hi>Matthew</hi> maketh eight, <hi>Luke</hi> reciteth but foure: and <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth the contrary woes, and <hi>Matthew</hi> doth omit them: whence this may in al like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood be collected, that Chriſt vſed diuers other words by way of expoſition to the Beatitudes, and ſo by conſequent to the petitions of the Lords prayer: and wee ſee directly that Chriſt expoundeth one petition, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifth: and why might he not alſo expound others? ſeeing that other petitions are as hard to bee vnderſtood as that: and this doth not any whit call into queſtion the truth of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, but doth rather commend vnto vs the ſpirit of wiſedome and truth wherewith they ſpake, in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers writers differing in words, ſtill agree in matter and ſubſtance of doctrine.

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond difference in words is in the fifth petition: for all the words in the originall differ, except two or three.</p>
               <p>The third difference is in the concluſion, which <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath, and <hi>Luke</hi> wanteth.</p>
               <p>Now by this difference betwixt <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> which is verbal not material, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence ariſeth, either that the Euangeliſts did not preciſely bind themſelues to the words that Chriſt vttered, or elſe that Chriſt vttered the Lords prayer in diuers words at the two ſeuerall times when he vttered it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Who prayeth beſt, he that ſaieth the Lords prayer,<note place="margin">VVho maketh the beſt prayer.</note> or he that ſaieth not the Lords prayer?</p>
               <p>For anſwere of this queſtion thus much:</p>
               <p>The Lords prayer is the beſt forme of prayer that euer was deuiſed.</p>
               <p>The Lords prayer is the beſt prayer that euer was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed.</p>
               <p>He that prayeth the Lords prayer in words and matter, prayeth well.</p>
               <p>Hee that prayeth the Lords prayer in matter onely,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18172:95"/> prayeth well, though he vſe other words, as Chriſt vſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, Iohn 17.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to ſay the Lords prayer, another thing to pray it.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to vſe the Lords prayer aright, another thing to abuſe it: for a good thing may be abſurdly abuſed.</p>
               <p>He that vſeth a deuiſed forme of prayer aright, prayeth more acceptably to God, than he that abuſeth the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>It is likely that he which can ſay nothing but the Lords prayer when he prayeth, cannot pray, but abuſeth the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that that man doth not ſinne which neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the words of the Lords prayer for a prayer, for that Chriſt did neuer intend to bind vs to the forme of words, but of matter.</p>
               <p>He that in particular hath conceiued his wants, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made his petitions to the Lord in a conceiued prayer, may neuer the leſſe end and conclude his prayer with the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>Diuers other doubtes concerning the vſe of the Lords prayer may bee propounded; but it is not profitable to make doubts, except that they could well be diſſolued: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much for a concluſion of this treatiſe of prayer: I had rather ſpeake fiue words to God in prayer, from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, faith and feeling, than ſay the Lords prayer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a thouſand times ignorantly, negligently, or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly.</p>
